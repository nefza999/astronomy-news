            title: 'It all started with a Big Bang – the quest to unravel the mystery behind the birth of the universe',
            author: 'Konstantinos Dimopoulos',
            introduction: 'How did everything begin? It\'s a question that humans have pondered for thousands of years. Over the last century or so, science has homed in on an answer: the Big Bang.',
            excerpt: 'A look at the evidence for the Big Bang, the cosmic microwave background, and the quest to understand what happened at the very beginning of the universe.',
            body: `This describes how the Universe was born in a cataclysmic explosion almost 14 billion years ago. In a tiny fraction of a second, the observable universe grew by the equivalent of a bacterium expanding to the size of the Milky Way. The early universe was extraordinarily hot and extremely dense. But how do we know this happened?

Let's look first at the evidence. In 1929, the American astronomer Edwin Hubble discovered that distant galaxies are moving away from each other, leading to the realisation that the universe is expanding. If we were to wind the clock back to the birth of the cosmos, the expansion would reverse and the galaxies would fall on top of each other 14 billion years ago. This age agrees nicely with the ages of the oldest astronomical objects we observe.

The idea was initially met with scepticism – and it was actually a sceptic, the English astronomer Fred Hoyle, who coined the name. Hoyle sarcastically dismissed the hypothesis as a "Big Bang" during an interview with BBC radio on March 28 1949.

Then, in 1964, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson detected a particular type of radiation that fills all of space. This became known as the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. It is a kind of afterglow of the Big Bang explosion, released when the cosmos was a mere 380,000 years old.

The CMB provides a window into the hot, dense conditions at the beginning of the universe. Penzias and Wilson were awarded the 1978 Nobel Prize in Physics for their discovery.

More recently, experiments at particle accelerators like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have shed light on conditions even closer to the time of the Big Bang. Our understanding of physics at these high energies suggests that, in the very first moments after the Big Bang, the four fundamental forces of physics that exist today were initially combined in a single force.

The present day four forces are gravity, electromagnetism, the strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force. As the universe expanded and cooled down, a series of dramatic changes, called phase transitions (like the boiling or freezing of water), separated these forces.

Experiments at particle accelerators suggest that a few billionths of a second after the Big Bang, the latest of these phase transitions took place. This was the breakdown of electroweak unification, when electromagnetism and the weak nuclear force ceased to be combined. This is when all the matter in the Universe assumed its mass.

Moving on further in time, the universe is filled with a strange substance called quark-gluon plasma. As the name suggests, this "primordial soup" was made up of quarks and gluons. These are sub-atomic particles that are responsible for the strong nuclear force. Quark-gluon plasma was artificially generated in 2010 at the Brookhaven National Laboratory and in 2015 at the LHC.

Quarks and gluons have a strong attraction for one other and today are bound together as protons and neutrons, which in turn are the building blocks of atoms. However, in the hot and dense conditions of the early universe, they existed independently.

The quark-gluon plasma didn't last long. Just a few millionths of a second after the Big Bang, as the universe expanded and cooled, quarks and gluons clumped together as protons and neutrons, the situation that persists today. This event is called quark confinement.

As the universe expanded and cooled still further, there were fewer high energy photons (particles of light) in the universe than there had previously been. This is a trigger for the process called Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN). This is when the first atomic nuclei – the dense lumps of matter made of protons and neutrons and found at the centres of atoms – formed through nuclear fusion reactions, like those that power the Sun.

Back when there were more high energy photons in the universe, any atomic nuclei that formed would have been quickly destroyed by them (a process called photodisintegration). BBN ceased just a few minutes after the Big Bang, but its consequences are observable today.

Observations by astronomers have provided us with evidence for the primordial abundances of elements produced in these fusion reactions. The results closely agree with the theory of BBN. If we continued on, over nearly 14 billion years of time, we would reach the situation that exists today. But how close can we get to understanding what was happening near the moment of the Big Bang itself?

Scientists have no direct evidence for what came before the breakdown of electroweak unification (when electromagnetism and the weak nuclear force ceased to be combined). At such high energies and early times, we can only stare at the mystery of the Big Bang. So what does theory suggest?

When we go backwards in time through the history of the cosmos, the distances and volumes shrink, while the average energy density grows. At the Big Bang, distances and volumes drop to zero, all parts of the universe fall on top of each other and the energy density of the universe becomes infinite. Our mathematical equations, which describe the evolution of space and the expansion of the cosmos, become infested by zeros and infinities and stop making sense.

We call this a singularity. Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity describes how spacetime is shaped. Spacetime is a way of describing the three-dimensional geometry of the universe, blended with time. A curvature in spacetime gives rise to gravity.

But mathematics suggests there are places in the universe where the curvature of spacetime becomes unlimited. These locations are known as singularities. One such example can be found at the centre of a black hole. At these places, the theory of general relativity breaks down.

From 1965 to 1966, the British theoretical physicists Stephen Hawking and Roger Penrose presented a number of mathematical theorems demonstrating that the spacetime of an expanding universe must end at a singularity in the past: the Big Bang singularity.

Penrose received the Nobel Prize in 2020. Hawking passed away in 2018 and Nobel Prizes are not awarded posthumously. Space and time appear at the Big Bang singularity, so questions of what happens "before" the Big Bang are not well defined. As far as science can tell, there is no before; the Big Bang is the onset of time.

However, nature is not accurately described by general relativity alone, even though the latter has been around for more than 100 years and has not been disproven. General relativity cannot describe atoms, nuclear fusion or radioactivity. These phenomena are instead addressed by quantum theory.

Theories from "classical" physics, such as relativity, are deterministic. This means that certain initial conditions have a definite outcome and are therefore absolutely predictive. Quantum theory, on the other hand, is probabilistic. This means that certain initial conditions in the universe can have multiple outcomes.

Quantum theory is somewhat predictive, but in a probabilistic way. Outcomes are assigned a probability of existing. If the mathematical distribution of probabilities is sharply peaked at a certain outcome, then the situation is well described by a "classical" theory such as general relativity. But not all systems are like this. In some systems, for example atoms, the probability distribution is spread out and a classical description does not apply.

What about gravity? In the vast majority of cases, gravity is well described by classical physics. Classical spacetime is smooth. However, when curvature becomes extreme, near a singularity, then the quantum nature of gravity cannot be ignored. Here, spacetime is no longer smooth, but gnarly, similar to a carpet which looks smooth from afar but up-close is full of fibres and threads.

Thus, near the Big Bang singularity, the structure of spacetime ceases to be smooth. Mathematical theorems suggest that spacetime becomes overwhelmed by "gnarly" features: hooks, loops and bubbles. This rapidly fluctuating situation is called spacetime foam.

In spacetime foam, causality does not apply, because there are closed loops in spacetime where the future of an event is also its past (so its outcome can also be its cause). The probabilistic nature of quantum theory suggests that, when the probability distribution is evenly spread out, all outcomes are equally possible and the comfortable notion of causality we associate with a classical understanding of physics is lost.

Therefore, if we go back in time, just before we encounter the Big Bang singularity, we find ourselves entering an epoch where the quantum effects of gravity are dominant and causality does not apply. This is called the Planck epoch.

Time ceases to be linear, going from the past to the future, and instead becomes wrapped, chaotic and random. This means the question "why did the Big Bang occur?" has no meaning, because outside causality, events do not need a cause to take place.

In order to understand how physics works at a singularity like the Big Bang, we need a theory for how gravity behaves according to quantum theory. Unfortunately, we do not have one. There are a number of efforts on this front like loop quantum gravity and string theory, with its various incarnations.

However, these efforts are at best incomplete, because the problem is notoriously difficult. This means that spacetime foam has a totemic, powerful mystique, much like the ancient Chaos of Hesiod which the Greeks believed existed in the beginning.

So how did our expanding and largely classical universe ever escape from spacetime foam? This brings us to cosmic inflation. The latter is defined as a period of accelerated expansion in the early universe. It was first introduced by the Russian theoretical physicist Alexei Starobinsky in 1980 and in parallel, that same year, by the American physicist Alan Guth, who coined the name.

Inflation makes the universe large and uniform, according to observations. It also forces the universe to be spatially flat, which is an otherwise unstable situation, but which has also been confirmed by observations. Moreover, inflation provides a natural mechanism to generate the primordial irregularities in the density of the universe that are essential for structures such as galaxies and galaxy clusters to form.

Precision observations of the cosmic microwave background in recent decades have spectacularly confirmed the predictions of inflation. We also know that the universe can indeed undergo accelerated expansion, because in the last few billion years it started doing it again.

What does this have to do with spacetime foam? Well, it turns out that, if the conditions for inflation arise (by chance) in a patch of fluctuating spacetime, as can occur with spacetime foam, then this region inflates and starts conforming to classical physics.

According to an idea first proposed by the Russian-American physicist Andrei Linde, inflation is a natural – and perhaps inevitable – consequence of chaotic initial conditions in the early universe.

The point is that our classical universe could have emerged from chaotic conditions, like those in spacetime foam, by experiencing an initial boost of inflation. This would have set off the expansion of the universe. In fact, the observations by astronomers of the CMB suggest that the initial boost is explosive, since the expansion is exponential during inflation.

In March 20 of 2014, Alan Guth explained it succinctly: "I usually describe inflation as a theory of the 'bang' of the Big Bang: It describes the propulsion mechanism that we call the Big Bang."

So, there you have it. The 14 billion year story of our universe begins with a cataclysmic explosion everywhere in space, which we call the Big Bang. That much is beyond reasonable doubt. This explosion is really a period of explosive expansion, which we call cosmic inflation. What happens before inflation, though? Is it a spacetime singularity, is it spacetime foam? The answer is largely unknown.

In fact, it might even be unknowable, because there is a mathematical theorem which forbids us from accessing information about the onset of inflation, much like the one that prevents us from knowing about the interiors of black holes. So, from our point of view, cosmic inflation is the Big Bang, the explosion that started it all.

            title: 'Tout a commencé par un Big Bang – la quête pour percer le mystère de la naissance de l\'univers',
            author: 'Konstantinos Dimopoulos',
            introduction: 'Comment tout a-t-il commencé ? C\'est une question que les humains se posent depuis des milliers d\'années. Au cours du dernier siècle environ, la science s\'est concentrée sur une réponse : le Big Bang.',
            excerpt: 'Un examen des preuves du Big Bang, du fond diffus cosmologique et de la quête pour comprendre ce qui s\'est passé au tout début de l\'univers.',
            body: `Cette théorie décrit comment l\'Univers est né d\'une explosion cataclysmique il y a près de 14 milliards d\'années. En une fraction de seconde, l\'univers observable a grandi de l\'équivalent d\'une bactérie s\'étendant à la taille de la Voie Lactée. L\'univers primitif était extraordinairement chaud et extrêmement dense. Mais comment savons-nous que cela s\'est produit ?

Commençons par les preuves. En 1929, l\'astronome américain Edwin Hubble a découvert que les galaxies lointaines s\'éloignaient les unes des autres, conduisant à la réalisation que l\'univers est en expansion. Si nous remontions le temps jusqu\'à la naissance du cosmos, l\'expansion s\'inverserait et les galaxies tomberaient les unes sur les autres il y a 14 milliards d\'années. Cet âge correspond bien aux âges des plus vieux objets astronomiques que nous observons.

L\'idée a d\'abord été accueillie avec scepticisme – et c\'est en fait un sceptique, l\'astronome anglais Fred Hoyle, qui a inventé le nom. Hoyle a rejeté avec sarcasme l\'hypothèse comme un « Big Bang » lors d\'une interview à la BBC le 28 mars 1949.

Puis, en 1964, Arno Penzias et Robert Wilson ont détecté un type particulier de rayonnement qui remplit tout l\'espace. Cela est devenu connu sous le nom de rayonnement du fond diffus cosmologique (CMB). C\'est une sorte de rémanence de l\'explosion du Big Bang, libérée lorsque le cosmos n\'avait que 380 000 ans.

Le CMB fournit une fenêtre sur les conditions chaudes et denses au début de l\'univers. Penzias et Wilson ont reçu le prix Nobel de physique en 1978 pour leur découverte.

Plus récemment, des expériences dans des accélérateurs de particules comme le Grand collisionneur de hadrons (LHC) ont éclairé des conditions encore plus proches du moment du Big Bang. Notre compréhension de la physique à ces hautes énergies suggère que, dans les tout premiers instants après le Big Bang, les quatre forces fondamentales de la physique qui existent aujourd\'hui étaient initialement combinées en une seule force.

Les quatre forces actuelles sont la gravité, l\'électromagnétisme, la force nucléaire forte et la force nucléaire faible. Alors que l\'univers s\'est étendu et refroidi, une série de changements dramatiques, appelés transitions de phase (comme l\'ébullition ou la congélation de l\'eau), ont séparé ces forces.

Des expériences dans des accélérateurs de particules suggèrent que quelques milliardièmes de seconde après le Big Bang, la dernière de ces transitions de phase a eu lieu. C\'était la rupture de l\'unification électrofaible, lorsque l\'électromagnétisme et la force nucléaire faible ont cessé d\'être combinés. C\'est à ce moment-là que toute la matière dans l\'Univers a assumé sa masse.

En avançant davantage dans le temps, l\'univers est rempli d\'une substance étrange appelée plasma quark-gluon. Comme son nom l\'indique, cette « soupe primordiale » était composée de quarks et de gluons. Ce sont des particules subatomiques responsables de la force nucléaire forte. Le plasma quark-gluon a été généré artificiellement en 2010 au Brookhaven National Laboratory et en 2015 au LHC.

Les quarks et les gluons ont une forte attraction les uns pour les autres et aujourd\'hui sont liés ensemble sous forme de protons et de neutrons, qui à leur tour sont les blocs de construction des atomes. Cependant, dans les conditions chaudes et denses de l\'univers primitif, ils existaient indépendamment.

Le plasma quark-gluon n\'a pas duré longtemps. Seulement quelques millionièmes de seconde après le Big Bang, alors que l\'univers s\'étendait et se refroidissait, les quarks et les gluons se sont regroupés en protons et neutrons, situation qui persiste aujourd\'hui. Cet événement est appelé confinement des quarks.

Alors que l\'univers continuait à s\'étendre et à se refroidir encore plus, il y avait moins de photons à haute énergie (particules de lumière) dans l\'univers qu\'auparavant. C\'est un déclencheur pour le processus appelé nucléosynthèse primordiale (BBN). C\'est à ce moment que les premiers noyaux atomiques – les morceaux denses de matière faits de protons et de neutrons et trouvés au centre des atomes – se sont formés par des réactions de fusion nucléaire, comme celles qui alimentent le Soleil.

À l\'époque où il y avait plus de photons à haute énergie dans l\'univers, tout noyau atomique qui se formait aurait été rapidement détruit par eux (un processus appelé photodésintégration). La BBN a cessé quelques minutes seulement après le Big Bang, mais ses conséquences sont observables aujourd\'hui.

Les observations des astronomes nous ont fourni des preuves des abondances primordiales d\'éléments produits dans ces réactions de fusion. Les résultats s\'accordent étroitement avec la théorie de la BBN. Si nous continuions, sur près de 14 milliards d\'années, nous atteindrions la situation qui existe aujourd\'hui. Mais à quel point pouvons-nous comprendre ce qui se passait près du moment du Big Bang lui-même ?

Les scientifiques n\'ont pas de preuve directe de ce qui s\'est passé avant la rupture de l\'unification électrofaible (lorsque l\'électromagnétisme et la force nucléaire faible ont cessé d\'être combinés). À des énergies aussi élevées et à des époques aussi anciennes, nous ne pouvons que contempler le mystère du Big Bang. Alors, que suggère la théorie ?

Lorsque nous remontons le temps à travers l\'histoire du cosmos, les distances et les volumes rétrécissent, tandis que la densité énergétique moyenne augmente. Au moment du Big Bang, les distances et les volumes tombent à zéro, toutes les parties de l\'univers tombent les unes sur les autres et la densité énergétique de l\'univers devient infinie. Nos équations mathématiques, qui décrivent l\'évolution de l\'espace et l\'expansion du cosmos, deviennent infestées de zéros et d\'infinis et cessent d\'avoir un sens.

Nous appelons cela une singularité. La théorie de la relativité générale d\'Albert Einstein décrit comment l\'espace-temps est façonné. L\'espace-temps est une façon de décrire la géométrie tridimensionnelle de l\'univers, mélangée au temps. Une courbure dans l\'espace-temps donne naissance à la gravité.

Mais les mathématiques suggèrent qu\'il existe des endroits dans l\'univers où la courbure de l\'espace-temps devient illimitée. Ces endroits sont connus sous le nom de singularités. Un tel exemple peut être trouvé au centre d\'un trou noir. À ces endroits, la théorie de la relativité générale s\'effondre.

De 1965 à 1966, les physiciens théoriciens britanniques Stephen Hawking et Roger Penrose ont présenté un certain nombre de théorèmes mathématiques démontrant que l\'espace-temps d\'un univers en expansion doit se terminer par une singularité dans le passé : la singularité du Big Bang.

Penrose a reçu le prix Nobel en 2020. Hawking est décédé en 2018 et les prix Nobel ne sont pas décernés à titre posthume. L\'espace et le temps apparaissent à la singularité du Big Bang, donc les questions sur ce qui se passe « avant » le Big Bang ne sont pas bien définies. Pour autant que la science puisse le dire, il n\'y a pas d\'avant ; le Big Bang est le début du temps.

Cependant, la nature n\'est pas décrite avec précision par la seule relativité générale, même si cette dernière existe depuis plus de 100 ans et n\'a pas été réfutée. La relativité générale ne peut pas décrire les atomes, la fusion nucléaire ou la radioactivité. Ces phénomènes sont plutôt abordés par la théorie quantique.

Les théories de la physique « classique », comme la relativité, sont déterministes. Cela signifie que certaines conditions initiales ont un résultat défini et sont donc absolument prédictives. La théorie quantique, quant à elle, est probabiliste. Cela signifie que certaines conditions initiales dans l\'univers peuvent avoir plusieurs résultats.

La théorie quantique est quelque peu prédictive, mais de manière probabiliste. Les résultats se voient attribuer une probabilité d\'existence. Si la distribution mathématique des probabilités est fortement concentrée sur un certain résultat, alors la situation est bien décrite par une théorie « classique » telle que la relativité générale. Mais tous les systèmes ne sont pas comme ça. Dans certains systèmes, par exemple les atomes, la distribution de probabilité est étalée et une description classique ne s\'applique pas.

Qu\'en est-il de la gravité ? Dans la grande majorité des cas, la gravité est bien décrite par la physique classique. L\'espace-temps classique est lisse. Cependant, lorsque la courbure devient extrême, près d\'une singularité, alors la nature quantique de la gravité ne peut être ignorée. Ici, l\'espace-temps n\'est plus lisse, mais noueux, semblable à un tapis qui semble lisse de loin mais qui, de près, est plein de fibres et de fils.

Ainsi, près de la singularité du Big Bang, la structure de l\'espace-temps cesse d\'être lisse. Les théorèmes mathématiques suggèrent que l\'espace-temps devient envahi par des caractéristiques « noueuses » : crochets, boucles et bulles. Cette situation fluctuant rapidement est appelée mousse d\'espace-temps.

Dans la mousse d\'espace-temps, la causalité ne s\'applique pas, car il y a des boucles fermées dans l\'espace-temps où le futur d\'un événement est aussi son passé (de sorte que son résultat peut aussi être sa cause). La nature probabiliste de la théorie quantique suggère que, lorsque la distribution de probabilité est uniformément répartie, tous les résultats sont également possibles et la notion confortable de causalité que nous associons à une compréhension classique de la physique est perdue.

Par conséquent, si nous remontons dans le temps, juste avant de rencontrer la singularité du Big Bang, nous nous retrouvons à entrer dans une époque où les effets quantiques de la gravité sont dominants et où la causalité ne s\'applique pas. C\'est ce qu\'on appelle l\'époque de Planck.

Le temps cesse d\'être linéaire, allant du passé vers le futur, et devient plutôt enveloppé, chaotique et aléatoire. Cela signifie que la question « pourquoi le Big Bang s\'est-il produit ? » n\'a pas de sens, car en dehors de la causalité, les événements n\'ont pas besoin d\'une cause pour se produire.

Afin de comprendre comment la physique fonctionne à une singularité comme le Big Bang, nous avons besoin d\'une théorie pour expliquer comment la gravité se comporte selon la théorie quantique. Malheureusement, nous n\'en avons pas. Il existe un certain nombre d\'efforts dans ce sens, comme la gravité quantique à boucles et la théorie des cordes, avec ses diverses incarnations.

Cependant, ces efforts sont au mieux incomplets, car le problème est notoirement difficile. Cela signifie que la mousse d\'espace-temps a une mystique totémique et puissante, un peu comme le Chaos antique d\'Hésiode que les Grecs croyaient exister au commencement.

Alors, comment notre univers en expansion et largement classique a-t-il jamais échappé à la mousse d\'espace-temps ? Cela nous amène à l\'inflation cosmique. Cette dernière est définie comme une période d\'expansion accélérée dans l\'univers primitif. Elle a été introduite pour la première fois par le physicien théoricien russe Alexei Starobinsky en 1980 et, parallèlement, la même année, par le physicien américain Alan Guth, qui a inventé le nom.

L\'inflation rend l\'univers grand et uniforme, selon les observations. Elle force également l\'univers à être spatialement plat, ce qui est une situation autrement instable, mais qui a également été confirmée par les observations. De plus, l\'inflation fournit un mécanisme naturel pour générer les irrégularités primordiales dans la densité de l\'univers qui sont essentielles pour la formation de structures telles que les galaxies et les amas de galaxies.

Des observations de précision du fond diffus cosmologique au cours des dernières décennies ont spectaculairement confirmé les prédictions de l\'inflation. Nous savons également que l\'univers peut en effet subir une expansion accélérée, car au cours des derniers milliards d\'années, il a recommencé à le faire.

Quel est le lien avec la mousse d\'espace-temps ? Eh bien, il s\'avère que, si les conditions de l\'inflation surviennent (par hasard) dans une région d\'espace-temps fluctuante, comme cela peut se produire avec la mousse d\'espace-temps, alors cette région s\'inflate et commence à se conformer à la physique classique.

Selon une idée proposée pour la première fois par le physicien russo-américain Andrei Linde, l\'inflation est une conséquence naturelle – et peut-être inévitable – des conditions initiales chaotiques dans l\'univers primitif.

Le fait est que notre univers classique pourrait avoir émergé de conditions chaotiques, comme celles de la mousse d\'espace-temps, en subissant une impulsion initiale d\'inflation. Cela aurait déclenché l\'expansion de l\'univers. En fait, les observations des astronomes du CMB suggèrent que l\'impulsion initiale est explosive, puisque l\'expansion est exponentielle pendant l\'inflation.

Le 20 mars 2014, Alan Guth l\'a expliqué succinctement : « Je décris généralement l\'inflation comme une théorie du « bang » du Big Bang : Elle décrit le mécanisme de propulsion que nous appelons le Big Bang. »

Voilà donc. L\'histoire de 14 milliards d\'années de notre univers commence par une explosion cataclysmique partout dans l\'espace, que nous appelons le Big Bang. Cela ne fait aucun doute raisonnable. Cette explosion est en réalité une période d\'expansion explosive, que nous appelons inflation cosmique. Mais que se passe-t-il avant l\'inflation ? Est-ce une singularité de l\'espace-temps, est-ce de la mousse d\'espace-temps ? La réponse est largement inconnue.

En fait, elle pourrait même être inconnaissable, car il existe un théorème mathématique qui nous interdit d\'accéder aux informations sur le début de l\'inflation, un peu comme celui qui nous empêche de connaître l\'intérieur des trous noirs. Donc, de notre point de vue, l\'inflation cosmique est le Big Bang, l\'explosion qui a tout déclenché.

            author: 'كونستانتينوس ديموبولوس',
            introduction: 'كيف بدأ كل شيء؟ هذا سؤال ظل البشر يفكرون فيه لآلاف السنين. على مدى القرن الماضي أو نحو ذلك، ركز العلم على إجابة واحدة: الانفجار العظيم.',
            excerpt: 'نظرة على الأدلة الخاصة بالانفجار العظيم، والخلفية الكونية الميكروية، والسعي لفهم ما حدث في بداية الكون.',
            body: `تصف هذه النظرية كيف ولد الكون في انفجار كارثي منذ حوالي 14 مليار سنة. في جزء صغير من الثانية، نما الكون المرصود بما يعادل تمدد بكتيريا إلى حجم مجرة درب التبانة. كان الكون المبكر حارًا جدًا وكثيفًا بشكل استثنائي. لكن كيف نعرف أن هذا حدث؟

دعونا ننظر أولاً إلى الأدلة. في عام 1929، اكتشف الفلكي الأمريكي إدوين هابل أن المجرات البعيدة تتحرك بعيدًا عن بعضها البعض، مما أدى إلى إدراك أن الكون يتوسع. إذا عدنا بالزمن إلى ولادة الكون، فسيعكس التوسع وستسقط المجرات فوق بعضها البعض منذ 14 مليار سنة. يتوافق هذا العمر بشكل جيد مع أعمار أقدم الأجرام الفلكية التي نرصدها.

قوبلت الفكرة في البداية بتشكيك – وكان المشكك هو الفلكي الإنجليزي فريد هويل الذي صاغ الاسم. رفض هويل الفرضية بسخرية على أنها "انفجار عظيم" خلال مقابلة مع إذاعة بي بي سي في 28 مارس 1949.

ثم في عام 1964، اكتشف أرنو بنزياس وروبرت ويلسون نوعًا معينًا من الإشعاع يملأ كل الفضاء. أصبح هذا يعرف بإشعاع الخلفية الكونية الميكروية (CMB). إنه نوع من التوهج اللاحق لانفجار الانفجار العظيم، الذي أطلق عندما كان الكون يبلغ من العمر 380,000 سنة فقط.

يوفر إشعاع الخلفية الكونية الميكروية نافذة على الظروف الحارة والكثيفة في بداية الكون. حصل بنزياس وويلسون على جائزة نوبل في الفيزياء عام 1978 لاكتشافهما.

في الآونة الأخيرة، سلطت التجارب في مسرعات الجسيمات مثل مصادم الهادرونات الكبير (LHC) الضوء على ظروف أقرب حتى إلى وقت الانفجار العظيم. يشير فهمنا للفيزياء عند هذه الطاقات العالية إلى أنه، في اللحظات الأولى بعد الانفجار العظيم، كانت القوى الأساسية الأربعة للفيزياء الموجودة اليوم مجتمعة في البداية في قوة واحدة.

القوى الأربعة الحالية هي الجاذبية، الكهرومغناطيسية، القوة النووية القوية، والقوة النووية الضعيفة. مع توسع الكون وبرودته، فصلت سلسلة من التغيرات الدراماتيكية، تسمى انتقالات الطور (مثل غليان الماء أو تجمده)، هذه القوى.

تشير التجارب في مسرعات الجسيمات إلى أن بضعة أجزاء من المليار من الثانية بعد الانفجار العظيم، حدث آخر هذه التحولات الطورية. كان هذا هو انهيار التوحيد الكهروضعيف، عندما توقفت الكهرومغناطيسية والقوة النووية الضعيفة عن الاتحاد. هذا هو الوقت الذي اكتسبت فيه كل المادة في الكون كتلتها.

بالانتقال إلى وقت لاحق، يملأ الكون مادة غريبة تسمى بلازما كوارك-غلوون. كما يشير الاسم، كانت هذه "الحساء البدائي" مكونة من كواركات وغلوونات. هذه هي جسيمات دون ذرية مسؤولة عن القوة النووية القوية. تم إنتاج بلازما الكوارك-غلوون اصطناعياً في عام 2010 في مختبر بروكهافن الوطني وفي عام 2015 في مصادم الهادرونات الكبير.

يجذب الكواركات والغلوونات بعضهم البعض بقوة وهم مرتبطون اليوم معاً كبروتونات ونيوترونات، والتي بدورها هي لبنات بناء الذرات. ومع ذلك، في الظروف الحارة والكثيفة للكون المبكر، كانت موجودة بشكل مستقل.

لم تدم بلازما الكوارك-غلوون طويلاً. بعد بضعة ملايين من الثانية فقط من الانفجار العظيم، مع توسع الكون وبرودته، تجمعت الكواركات والغلوونات معاً كبروتونات ونيوترونات، وهي الحالة التي تستمر حتى اليوم. يسمى هذا الحدث حصر الكوارك.

مع استمرار الكون في التوسع والبرودة أكثر، أصبح هناك عدد أقل من الفوتونات عالية الطاقة (جسيمات الضوء) في الكون مقارنة بما كان عليه سابقًا. هذا هو المحفز لعملية تسمى التخليق النووي للانفجار العظيم (BBN). هذا هو الوقت الذي تشكلت فيه النوى الذرية الأولى - الكتل الكثيفة من المادة المصنوعة من البروتونات والنيوترونات الموجودة في مراكز الذرات - من خلال تفاعلات الاندماج النووي، مثل تلك التي تمد الشمس بالطاقة.

في الماضي، عندما كان هناك المزيد من الفوتونات عالية الطاقة في الكون، فإن أي نوى ذرية تتشكل كانت ستتدمر بسرعة بواسطتها (عملية تسمى التفكك الضوئي). توقفت عملية BBN بعد دقائق قليلة من الانفجار العظيم، لكن عواقبها قابلة للملاحظة اليوم.

وفرت ملاحظات الفلكيين لنا أدلة على الوفرة البدائية للعناصر المنتجة في تفاعلات الاندماج هذه. تتوافق النائج بشكل وثيق مع نظرية BBN. إذا استمررنا، على مدى ما يقرب من 14 مليار سنة من الزمن، سنصل إلى الوضع الموجود اليوم. ولكن ما مدى قربنا من فهم ما كان يحدث بالقرب من لحظة الانفجار العظيم نفسها؟

ليس لدى العلماء دليل مباشر على ما حدث قبل انهيار التوحيد الكهروضعيف (عندما توقفت الكهرومغناطيسية والقوة النووية الضعيفة عن الاتحاد). عند مثل هذه الطاقات العالية والأزمنة المبكرة، لا يمكننا إلا أن نحدق في لغز الانفجار العظيم. إذن ماذا تقترح النظرية؟

عندما نعود بالزمن عبر تاريخ الكون، تتقلص المسافات والحجوم، بينما تزداد كثافة الطاقة المتوسطة. عند الانفجار العظيم، تنخفض المسافات والحجوم إلى الصفر، وتسقط جميع أجزاء الكون فوق بعضها البعض وتصبح كثافة طاقة الكون لانهائية. تصبح معادلاتنا الرياضية، التي تصف تطور الفضاء واتساع الكون، مليئة بالأصفار واللانهايات وتفقد معناها.

نسمي هذا التفرد. تصف نظرية النسبية العامة لألبرت أينشتاين كيف يتشكل الزمكان. الزمكان هو طريقة لوصف الهندسة ثلاثية الأبعاد للكون، مختلطة مع الزمن. يؤدي انحناء الزمكان إلى ظهور الجاذبية.

لكن الرياضيات تشير إلى وجود أماكن في الكون حيث يصبح انحناء الزمكان غير محدود. تُعرف هذه المواقع باسم التفردات. يمكن العثور على أحد هذه الأمثلة في مركز الثقب الأسود. في هذه الأماكن، تنهار نظرية النسبية العامة.

من عام 1965 إلى عام 1966، قدم الفيزيائيان النظريان البريطانيان ستيفن هوكينغ وروجر بنروز عددًا من النظريات الرياضية التي تثبت أن زمكان الكون المتوسع يجب أن ينتهي عند تفرد في الماضي: تفرد الانفجار العظيم.

حصل بنروز على جائزة نوبل في عام 2020. توفي هوكينغ في عام 2018 ولا تُمنح جوائز نوبل بعد الوفاة. يظهر المكان والزمان عند تفرد الانفجار العظيم، لذا فإن أسئلة ما يحدث "قبل" الانفجار العظيم ليست محددة جيدًا. بقدر ما تستطيع العلم أن تخبرنا، ليس هناك ما قبل؛ الانفجار العظيم هو بداية الزمن.

ومع ذلك، لا يتم وصف الطبيعة بدقة من خلال النسبية العامة وحدها، على الرغم من أن الأخيرة موجودة منذ أكثر من 100 عام ولم يتم دحضها. لا تستطيع النسبية العامة وصف الذرات أو الاندماج النووي أو النشاط الإشعاعي. يتم تناول هذه الظواهر بدلاً من ذلك من خلال نظرية الكم.

نظريات الفيزياء "الكلاسيكية"، مثل النسبية، حتمية. هذا يعني أن الظروف الأولية المعينة لها نتيجة محددة وبالتالي يمكن التنبؤ بها بشكل مطلق. من ناحية أخرى، نظرية الكم احتمالية. هذا يعني أن الظروف الأولية المعينة في الكون يمكن أن يكون لها نتائج متعددة.

نظرية الكم تنبؤية إلى حد ما، ولكن بطريقة احتمالية. يتم تعيين احتمالية الوجود للنتائج. إذا كانت التوزيع الرياضي للاحتمالات يرتفع بشكل حاد عند نتيجة معينة، فإن الوضع يوصف بشكل جيد بنظرية "كلاسيكية" مثل النسبية العامة. لكن ليس كل الأنظمة هكذا. في بعض الأنظمة، على سبيل المثال الذرات، ينتشر توزيع الاحتمالات ولا ينطبق الوصف الكلاسيكي.

ماذا عن الجاذبية؟ في الغالبية العظمى من الحالات، توصف الجاذبية بشكل جيد من خلال الفيزياء الكلاسيكية. الزمكان الكلاسيكي أملس. ومع ذلك، عندما يصبح الانحناء شديدًا، بالقرب من التفرد، فلا يمكن تجاهل الطبيعة الكمية للجاذبية. هنا، لم يعد الزمكان أملسًا، ولكنه متعرج، يشبه السجادة التي تبدو ملساء من بعيد ولكن من قريب تكون مليئة بالألياف والخيوط.

وهكذا، بالقرب من تفرد الانفجار العظيم، تتوقف بنية الزمكان عن كونها ملساء. تشير النظريات الرياضية إلى أن الزمكان يصبح مغمورًا بسمات "متعرجة": خطاطيف وحلقات وفقاعات. تسمى هذه الحالة المتقلبة بسرعة رغوة الزمكان.

في رغوة الزمكان، لا تنطبق السببية، لأن هناك حلقات مغلقة في الزمكان حيث يكون مستقبل حدث ما هو أيضًا ماضيه (بحيث يمكن أن تكون نتيجته أيضًا سببه). تشير الطبيعة الاحتمالية لنظرية الكم إلى أنه عندما يكون توزيع الاحتمالات منتشرًا بالتساوي، فإن جميع النتائج ممكنة بنفس القدر وتضيع فكرة السببية المريحة التي نربطها بالفهم الكلاسيكي للفيزياء.

لذلك، إذا عدنا بالزمن إلى الوراء، قبل أن نواجه تفرد الانفجار العظيم مباشرة، نجد أنفسنا ندخل حقبة تكون فيها التأثيرات الكمية للجاذبية هي المهيمنة ولا تنطبق السببية. هذا ما يسمى بحقبة بلانك.

يتوقف الزمن عن كونه خطيًا، ينتقل من الماضي إلى المستقبل، ويصبح بدلاً من ذلك ملفوفًا وفوضويًا وعشوائيًا. هذا يعني أن السؤال "لماذا حدث الانفجار العظيم؟" ليس له معنى، لأنه خارج السببية، لا تحتاج الأحداث إلى سبب لحدوثها.

من أجل فهم كيفية عمل الفيزياء في تفرد مثل الانفجار العظيم، نحتاج إلى نظرية لشرح كيفية تصرف الجاذبية وفقًا لنظرية الكم. لسوء الحظ، ليس لدينا واحدة. هناك عدد من الجهود في هذا الصدد مثل جاذبية الكم الحلقية ونظرية الأوتار، مع تجسيداتها المختلفة.

ومع ذلك، هذه الجهود غير مكتملة على أفضل تقدير، لأن المشكلة صعبة للغاية. هذا يعني أن رغوة الزمكان لها غموض قوي وطوطمي، يشبه إلى حد كبير الفوضى القديمة لهزيود التي اعتقد اليونانيون أنها موجودة في البداية.

إذن كيف تمكن كوننا المتوسع والكلاسيكي إلى حد كبير من الهروب من رغوة الزمكان؟ هذا يقودنا إلى التضخم الكوني. يُعرَّف الأخير بأنه فترة توسع متسارع في الكون المبكر. قدمه لأول مرة الفيزيائي النظري الروسي أليكسي ستاروبينسكي في عام 1980 وبالتوازي، في نفس العام، من قبل الفيزيائي الأمريكي آلان غوث، الذي صاغ الاسم.

يجعل التضخم الكون كبيرًا وموحدًا، وفقًا للملاحظات. كما يجبر الكون على أن يكون مسطحًا مكانيًا، وهي حالة غير مستقرة بخلاف ذلك، ولكن تم تأكيدها أيضًا بالملاحظات. علاوة على ذلك، يوفر التضخم آلية طبيعية لتوليد الاختلالات البدائية في كثافة الكون التي تعتبر ضرورية لتشكيل هياكل مثل المجرات والعناقيد المجرية.

أكدت الملاحظات الدقيقة للخلفية الكونية الميكروية في العقود الأخيرة تنبؤات التضخم بشكل مذهل. نعلم أيضًا أن الكون يمكنه بالفعل الخضوع لتوسع متسارع، لأنه في آخر بضعة مليارات من السنين بدأ يفعل ذلك مرة أخرى.

ما علاقة هذا برغوة الزمكان؟ حسنًا، اتضح أنه إذا ظهرت شروط التضخم (بالصدفة) في رقعة من الزمكان المتقلب، كما يمكن أن يحدث مع رغوة الزمكان، فإن هذه المنطقة تتضخم وتبدأ في التوافق مع الفيزياء الكلاسيكية.

وفقًا لفكرة اقترحها الفيزيائي الروسي الأمريكي أندريه ليند لأول مرة، فإن التضخم هو نتيجة طبيعية – وربما حتمية – للظروف الأولية الفوضوية في الكون المبكر.

النقطة المهمة هي أن كوننا الكلاسيكي كان يمكن أن ينشأ من ظروف فوضوية، مثل تلك الموجودة في رغوة الزمكان، من خلال تجربة دفعة أولية من التضخم. كان من شأن ذلك أن يؤدي إلى توسع الكون. في الواقع، تشير ملاحظات الفلكيين لـ CMB إلى أن الدفعة الأولية هي انفجارية، حيث أن التوسع أسي خلال التضخم.

في 20 مارس 2014، شرح آلان غوث ذلك بإيجاز: "عادة ما أصف التضخم على أنه نظرية 'الانفجار' للانفجار العظيم: إنه يصف آلية الدفع التي نسميها الانفجار العظيم."

إذن ها أنت ذا. تبدأ قصة كوننا البالغة 14 مليار سنة بانفجار كارثي في كل مكان في الفضاء، نسميه الانفجار العظيم. هذا لا يدع مجالاً للشك المعقول. هذا الانفجار هو في الواقع فترة من التوسع الانفجاري، نسميها التضخم الكوني. لكن ماذا يحدث قبل التضخم؟ هل هو تفرد الزمكان، هل هو رغوة الزمكان؟ الجواب غير معروف إلى حد كبير.

في الواقع، قد يكون غير معروف، لأن هناك نظرية رياضية تمنعنا من الوصول إلى المعلومات حول بداية التضخم، تمامًا مثل النظرية التي تمنعنا من معرفة ما بداخل الثقوب السوداء. لذا، من وجهة نظرنا، التضخم الكوني هو الانفجار العظيم، الانفجار الذي بدأ كل شيء.

        title: 'Black Holes: the ultimate abyss',
        author: 'Dr Richard Smith',
        introduction: 'It used to be thought that the world was flat. That beyond the horizon lurked a bottomless void, measureless to humans. As our ships got better and our navigators more confident, vessels that disappeared over one horizon began returning triumphant from the other. The Earth was curved, a sphere with no edges. We didn\'t fall off because a mysterious force called gravity kept everyone and everything stuck to the planet\'s surface.',
        excerpt: 'Black holes are bottomless voids in the sea of curved space, the ultimate abyss from which nothing can escape.',
        body: `Then Albert Einstein came along and told us that space itself was curved. Now we realise that if we sail off into the sea of curved space we call the Universe, there are indeed bottomless voids that the unwary traveler can fall into - and they are measureless to humans. They lurk on the other side of their own dark horizons, and we call them Black Holes.

## FATAL ATTRACTION

A black hole is an astronomical contradiction - a dark star, an invisible nothing, a prison of light. Its boundary is marked by the so-called Event Horizon, a sphere of darkness that shrouds the inside and defines the point of no return. There is no solid surface beyond, just a bottomless gravitational whirlpool so strong that it sucks everything - even light - relentlessly inward. Oblivion waits at the centre in the form of the Singularity, Gravity's fatal attractor.

Hidden eternally from view, the Singularity marks the spot where an immense gravitational force has been concentrated. All the mass, light and energy that has ever fallen into the black hole is compressed by its own overwhelming gravity into a point that is infinitely small and infinitely dense. The more a black hole swallows, the heavier it gets, yet the singularity never changes. Space has been squelched out of existence and Time has been squeezed to a stop. Step over the event horizon and for all intents and purposes you've fallen off the edge of the universe.

## A BRIEF HISTORY OF GRAVITY

The concept of Gravity, this unseen force that dominates our lives and pulls us eternally towards the ground, has long challenged the greatest human minds. Even in Galileo's day, the tower at Pisa had a good lean to it - perfect for dropping things off. Galileo wondered why no matter how heavy or light objects were, they all took the same amount of time to fall to Earth. He puzzled too about why the planets moved they way they did. His conviction that they orbited around the sun led to house arrest for heresy. He was still trying to put the gravity puzzle together when he died in Florence in 1642.

On Christmas Day that same year, the gravity baton was handed to Isaac Newton, born weak and premature in a Lincolnshire farmhouse. Twenty three years later, Newton returned to Woolsthorpe Manor to sit out the plague sweeping southern England. With 18 months quiet thought in the countryside he discovered calculus, unravelled the nature of light, and began formulating laws for the motion of the planets: discoveries that still underpin most of modern physics. One day when he was having a short break with a cup of tea, a falling apple interrupted his thoughts and led him to ponder gravity itself.

The reason the apple fell straight down was that it was trying to fall to the centre of the earth where gravitational attraction was focused. And the Earth wasn't the only object that had gravity, so did the moon, the sun and the planets. In fact, Newton reasoned, every object in the universe - including ourselves - has gravity. The bigger and heavier, the greater it's gravitational force. We are glued to the surface of the Earth - and not the other way round - only because it is has so much more mass. The Earth orbits around the sun for the same reason. Finally, Newton had found a reason for the heavens to move the way they do.

## DARK STARS

In 1784, John Michell, Rector of Thornhill Church in Yorkshire and great forgotten 18th Century scientist, became intrigued with the idea of escape velocity - the minimum speed with which you need to travel upwards from a star or planet to escape its gravitational clutches. He knew that gravity depended upon mass and he knew the speed of light was fast but finite. How heavy, he wondered, would the sun have to become before its gravity would become so great that even light (which travels at 299,792 km/second) would be held back at its surface? The answer, Michell reasoned, was that if the sun was the same size but weighed 500 times more, the light from the Sun would not escape the Suns own gravity. The Sun would simply disappear from view. A few years later the great French mathematician Laplace came to the same conclusion independently. The concept of the Dark Star was born.

## A UNIVERSE OF HOLES

Black holes remained an ignored theoretical curio until a young clerk in a Swiss patent office published his General Theory of Relativity in 1915. Albert Einstein realised that the universe was a fundamentally different place to the clockwork universe of Newton and commonsense. The three dimensions of space could not be separated from the fourth dimension of time. Together they form the "Spacetime" continuum, a kind of invisible scaffolding that defines existence. Spacetime, though, is not an absolute, fixed thing. It can be warped, bent and curved.

Spacetime is "straight" only when it doesn't have anything in it. Wherever there is mass, there is gravity. Wherever there is gravity, space is curved. The curvature of space dictates how an object will move through it. The object will dictate how space bends around it. Gravity, according to Einstein, is the curvature of space.

Einstein's thought experiment was to imagine space and time being squashed flat like a 2D rubber sheet. Put a massive object like the sun on the sheet and it will bend. The more dense an object is, the deeper the depression it makes in Spacetime and the stronger the gravity. Eventually a point is reached when the walls of the depression are stretched so steeply that nothing can climb out of it. It is, quite literally, a hole in the universe.

## A STAR IS BORN

To understand the very large in the universe, you need to start with the very small. With the unlocking of the secrets of nuclear energy, scientists finally got a clue to how black holes might form in nature. Stars are born when enormous clouds of cosmic dust and hydrogen begin to clump and condense under their own gravitational weight. Gravity grows stronger by the hour as the increasing density of the protostar curves space more strongly. Faster and faster, the hydrogen gas falls in upon itself in the condensing core. The more it collides the hotter it grows. When the core reaches 10 million degrees, the hydrogen protons begin to fuse into helium. Some of the mass disappears, having being turned into energy and light. Like a giant cosmic light bulb, the star has switched itself on.

Every star we see in the heavens has a giant nuclear reaction raging at its core. It's what makes a star like our sun shine so hot and bright. Gravity is still trying to pull the star's gas tighter and tighter but is matched now by the energy pouring outwards from the nuclear reaction in the core. The star settles into a precarious balance that gravity will always win in the end.

## THE BIG SQUEEZE

The ultimate fate of a star depends upon its mass. Our sun is middle-aged. It switched on 5 billion years ago and has enough fuel to burn for 5 billion more. But when, in that far distant future, the spent heart of the sun sheds its outer layers and shuts down, gravity will squeeze the core so tight it cannot be squeezed any more. It will become a "white dwarf", a feeble ember the size of the earth but a hundred thousand times more dense.

The more massive the star is, the faster it burns its fuel and the shorter its life expectancy. A star 10 times as massive as the sun may survive only millions, not billions, of years. As it starts to collapse, the crush of in-falling matter slamming into the iron core sends the temperature rocketing to 50 billion degrees. The core has only seconds to respond - and it does so Supernova-style.

A supernova is a massive explosion. Huge quantities of material are blown into space, but only from the outer regions of the star. Most of the star has actually imploded, with the core being given a gravity bear hug so extreme that the protons and electrons have been squeezed into a ball of superdense subatomic particles called neutrons. The resulting "neutron star" would weigh about one and a half times as much as the sun but would measure only about 20 kilometres across - about the size of Brisbane.

Astronomers can prove that neutron stars exist, because they give off a unique distress signal. Like a lighthouse warning of a dangerous shore, a neutron star sweeps space with a blinding beam of radiation, generated by a magnetic field more than a trillion times greater than the Earth's. Such a neutron star is called a pulsar. To astronomers, the pulsing beam sweeping the darkness of space is an unmistakable warning that extreme gravity lurks nearby.

## GRAVITY'S FINAL TRIUMPH

A neutron star resist the ongoing crush of gravity, only with its neutrons packed in like sardines in a tin. But if the remnants of the star after supernova weigh more than three times the mass of the sun, even neutrons cannot hold back the inexorable force of gravity. The neutrons are squashed into oblivion. The star's core becomes so dense that gravity overwhelms space itself, distorting it so horribly that it, and time with it, is wrenched off from the outside universe. A darkness forms at the star's heart and moves relentlessly outwards as the stars brilliance is sucked inwards. This is the hungry, growing maw of a black hole: gravity's final triumph. There is no escape, no turning back, until the entire mass of the star has been swallowed and its brilliance completely extinguished.

## A BLACKNESS BEYOND BLACK

Visible only by its invisibility, the margin of the black hole is marked by the event horizon, so-called because all events beyond are hidden from view. For a black hole like this the event horizon may be only a few kilometres in diameter but the void beyond impossibly deep to measure. The entire mass of the star has been reduced to a singularity - a point of infinite smallness and infinite density at the very centre of this black malevolence.

The singularity is where science ends and speculation begins. Space and time have ceased to exist, replaced by a seething chaotic mass we call quantum foam. This bizarre conjecture is where Einstein's laws fail. This is where the laws of quantum mechanics fail. This is the realm of something called Quantum Gravity - one of the hottest areas of advanced mathematical research.

It is from a singularity that the Universe is believed to have begun. In many ways the collapse of a star to form a black hole singularity is the reverse of the Big Bang. Is this the way the Universe is going to end? Wilder speculation is that our entire universe might lurk inside someone else's singularity. or even that universes can bud off from each other like this, like some sort of heavenly breeding organism.

It wasn't until 1967 that John Archibald Wheeler slipped the term "Black Hole" into his paper at a scientific conference, and into the lexicon of the late 20th Century. They may have become a household name - but are they real?

## BLACK HOLE OR WHITE ELEPHANT

Einstein himself couldn't believe that such an invisible impossibility as a black hole could exist in the real universe beyond his theories. Today, his successors have no such problems. Astronomers not only think they have identified nearly 30 black hole candidates in our own Milky Way galaxy, they are now getting the proof that the holes behave in the relativistic way that Einstein's theories predict.

A black hole is an elusive quarry with perfect camouflage: total blackness in the blackness of space. Searching for a black hole no bigger than Sydney's CBD across hundreds or thousands of light years of space demands a sneaky approach. First you have to find a visible star that a black hole has trapped in orbit. Then you have to study how the star wobbles. John Wheeler described it as like looking for a pair of dancers on a dark dance floor. The heavy man dressed in black is invisible, but the bright white dress of a light women is an easy target as she is whirled around. Astronomers look for the bright stars that "orbit" dark partners in the same way.

One of the best candidates is the star called V404 Cygni. Calculations shows V404's dark partner is twelve times more massive than our Sun, yet totally invisible. But for every black hole orbiting another star, there must be many more solitary ones yet unseen. One of these could lurk quietly much closer to home.

## THE COSMIC HOOVER

Although black holes have the power to hoover up anything and everything that strays too close, they can't hunt. Contrary to popular belief, if you replaced our Sun with a black hole of the same mass the Earth wouldn't get sucked in, there just wouldn't be any sunlight. You could even orbit a black hole in a spacecraft just so long as you kept a safe distance.

Get too close though and strange things start happening. Space gets stretched longer and skinnier. You would find your feet being pulled miles away in front of you while your body is squeezed sideways. You will have become a piece of space spaghetti long before you reach the event horizon. Then you'd be ruptured into your own fundamental particles and disappear behind the veil of darkness.

It'd be a spectacular way to go but no-one would see it because time is being stretched as well. The photons carrying the image would struggle harder to leave your body the closer you fell. Even with a few million years to spare, an outside observer will see you slow to a halt above the event horizon, before slowly fading from view.

## HEARTS OF DARKNESS

Most astronomers now concede that a black hole heavyweight lurks in the centre of our own Milky Way galaxy. Latest estimates are that it weighs in at a whopping 2 million times the mass of the sun - a dwarf in comparison to some of the truly supermassive black holes that may lurk in the cosmos.

By the 1950s, astronomers began turning optical telescopes towards some of the strongest signals that the new radio telescopes were picking up. Source number 3C 273 was found to be a bright star-like object with a 'jet' of intense radiation sticking out of it. It was the first of a number of similar objects given the name of "quasar" or 'quasi-stellar radio source', but their real identity remained hidden for decades.

Quasars have now been revealed to be the energetic hearts of very active galaxies: brilliant discs of superheated gas and ruptured stars swirling at nearly the speed of light. Great jets of charged particles are blasted thousands of light years into space from above & below - like an axle through a wheel. The central engine that is driving all this activity, though, is hidden deep inside. It has to be small and it must be extraordinarily dense. The mathematics demand that the only beast that can drive such a display of raw power is a supermassive black hole. The heavier the hole, the faster the gases whirl in orbit. Astronomers have observed speeds which tally with black holes weighing up to five thousand million suns.

The theory goes like this: a galaxy evolves from a vast rotating cloud of gas that begins to clump and condense under its own weight into billions of stars arranged like an enormous Catherine wheel, a Mexican hat or a bee swarm. In the centre, where the gas is concentrated, enough matter to make millions or even billions stars has undergone titanic gravitational collapse to make a supermassive black hole. While the hole is still actively feeding on the inner part of the new galaxy it manifests itself as a quasar. Later, when all nearby food has been consumed, the black hole becomes quiescent, leaving a relatively quiet galactic core like the one in the Milky Way. If this theory is correct, then supermassive black holes are present in all but the smallest galaxies.

## TOWARDS THE WITHIN

For all their ferocity, these supermassive black holes are surprisingly gentle giants up close. You can fall into one without turning to spaghetti.

Suppose you or I were an astronaut about to step into such an abyss at the edge of the universe. As I approach the event horizon, blackness spreads upwards around me. The Universe shrinks to a bright point directly overhead. As I meet and cross the horizon the universe above disappears in a blinding flash of photons trapped in orbit around the hole.

I am now inside the black hole and falling towards the Singularity. It's not dark like I expected. I see a ring of dancing light where the singularity should be. It must be spinning so fast that the centrifugal force has balanced out gravity. Now it's a naked glowing hula-hoop of indeterminate size. Around it I see glimpses of heavens unimaginable to humans, universes within universes, time within time...

But hey! No matter what I might see or experience inside the black hole, I could never send a message out. The secrets I discover will die with me as I achieve oneness with the Universe, at the central Singularity.`,

À mesure que nos navires s\'amélioraient et que nos navigateurs prenaient de l\'assurance, les vaisseaux qui disparaissaient d\'un horizon commencèrent à revenir triomphants de l\'autre. La Terre était courbe, une sphère sans bords. Nous ne tombions pas parce qu\'une force mystérieuse appelée gravité maintenait tout et tous collés à la surface de la planète.',

        body: `Puis Albert Einstein est venu et nous a dit que l'espace lui-même était courbe. Maintenant, nous réalisons que si nous naviguons dans la mer de l'espace courbe que nous appelons l'Univers, il existe en effet des vides sans fond dans lesquels le voyageur imprudent peut tomber - et ils sont immesurables pour les humains. Ils se cachent de l'autre côté de leurs propres horizons sombres, et nous les appelons Trous Noirs.

## ATTRACTION FATALE

Un trou noir est une contradiction astronomique - une étoile sombre, un néant invisible, une prison de lumière. Sa frontière est marquée par ce qu'on appelle l'Horizon des Événements, une sphère de ténèbres qui voile l'intérieur et définit le point de non-retour. Au-delà, il n'y a pas de surface solide, juste un tourbillon gravitationnel sans fond si puissant qu'il aspire tout - même la lumière - inexorablement vers l'intérieur. L'oubli attend au centre sous la forme de la Singularité, l'attracteur fatal de la Gravité.

Cachée éternellement à la vue, la Singularité marque l'endroit où une immense force gravitationnelle s'est concentrée. Toute la masse, la lumière et l'énergie jamais tombées dans le trou noir sont comprimées par sa propre gravité écrasante en un point infiniment petit et infiniment dense. Plus un trou noir avale, plus il devient lourd, pourtant la singularité ne change jamais. L'espace a été expulsé de l'existence et le Temps a été comprimé jusqu'à l'arrêt. Franchissez l'horizon des événements et à toutes fins utiles, vous êtes tombé du bord de l'univers.

## UNE BRÈVE HISTOIRE DE LA GRAVITÉ

Le concept de Gravité, cette force invisible qui domine nos vies et nous tire éternellement vers le sol, a longtemps défié les plus grands esprits humains. Même à l'époque de Galilée, la tour de Pise avait une bonne inclinaison - parfaite pour y faire tomber des choses. Galilée se demandait pourquoi, quels que soient leur poids ou leur légèreté, tous les objets mettaient le même temps à tomber sur Terre. Il s'interrogeait aussi sur la raison du mouvement des planètes. Sa conviction qu'elles orbitent autour du soleil lui valut la mise en résidence pour hérésie. Il essayait encore de résoudre l'énigme de la gravité lorsqu'il mourut à Florence en 1642.

Le jour de Noël de la même année, le relais de la gravité fut transmis à Isaac Newton, né faible et prématuré dans une ferme du Lincolnshire. Vingt-trois ans plus tard, Newton retourna au manoir de Woolsthorpe pour attendre la fin de la peste qui balayait le sud de l'Angleterre. Avec 18 mois de réflexion tranquille à la campagne, il découvrit le calcul infinitésimal, démêla la nature de la lumière, et commença à formuler des lois pour le mouvement des planètes : des découvertes qui sous-tendent encore la majeure partie de la physique moderne. Un jour, alors qu'il faisait une petite pause avec une tasse de thé, une pomme tombante interrompit ses pensées et le conduisit à méditer sur la gravité elle-même.

La raison pour laquelle la pomme tomba tout droit était qu'elle essayait de tomber vers le centre de la terre où l'attraction gravitationnelle était concentrée. Et la Terre n'était pas le seul objet à avoir une gravité, il en était de même pour la lune, le soleil et les planètes. En fait, raisonna Newton, chaque objet de l'univers - y compris nous-mêmes - a une gravité. Plus l'objet est gros et lourd, plus sa force gravitationnelle est grande. Nous sommes collés à la surface de la Terre - et non l'inverse - seulement parce qu'elle a tellement plus de masse. La Terre orbite autour du soleil pour la même raison. Enfin, Newton avait trouvé une raison au mouvement des cieux.

## ÉTOILES SOMBRES

En 1784, John Michell, recteur de l'église de Thornhill dans le Yorkshire et grand scientifique oublié du 18e siècle, s'intéressa à l'idée de vitesse de libération - la vitesse minimale à laquelle il faut se déplacer vers le haut depuis une étoile ou une planète pour échapper à son emprise gravitationnelle. Il savait que la gravité dépendait de la masse et il savait que la vitesse de la lumière était rapide mais finie. Combien, se demanda-t-il, le soleil devrait-il devenir lourd pour que sa gravité devienne si grande que même la lumière (qui voyage à 299 792 km/seconde) serait retenue à sa surface ? La réponse, raisonna Michell, était que si le soleil avait la même taille mais pesait 500 fois plus, la lumière du Soleil n'échapperait pas à la gravité du Soleil lui-même. Le Soleil disparaîtrait simplement de la vue. Quelques années plus tard, le grand mathématicien français Laplace arriva indépendamment à la même conclusion. Le concept de l'Étoile Sombre était né.

## UN UNIVERS DE TROUS

Les trous noirs restèrent une curiosité théorique ignorée jusqu'à ce qu'un jeune employé d'un bureau de brevets suisse publie sa Théorie Générale de la Relativité en 1915. Albert Einstein réalisa que l'univers était un endroit fondamentalement différent de l'univers mécanique de Newton et du sens commun. Les trois dimensions de l'espace ne pouvaient être séparées de la quatrième dimension, le temps. Ensemble, ils forment le continuum "Espace-Temps", une sorte d'échafaudage invisible qui définit l'existence. L'espace-temps, cependant, n'est pas une chose absolue et fixe. Il peut être déformé, plié et courbé.

L'espace-temps est "droit" seulement quand il n'y a rien dedans. Là où il y a de la masse, il y a de la gravité. Là où il y a de la gravité, l'espace est courbe. La courbure de l'espace dicte comment un objet se déplacera à travers lui. L'objet dictera comment l'espace se courbe autour de lui. La gravité, selon Einstein, est la courbure de l'espace.

L'expérience de pensée d'Einstein était d'imaginer l'espace et le temps aplatis comme une feuille de caoutchouc en 2D. Mettez un objet massif comme le soleil sur la feuille et elle se pliera. Plus un objet est dense, plus la dépression qu'il crée dans l'Espace-Temps est profonde et plus la gravité est forte. Finalement, un point est atteint où les parois de la dépression sont étirées si abruptement que rien ne peut en sortir. C'est, littéralement, un trou dans l'univers.

## UNE ÉTOILE EST NÉE

Pour comprendre le très grand dans l'univers, il faut commencer par le très petit. Avec la révélation des secrets de l'énergie nucléaire, les scientifiques ont finalement eu un indice sur la façon dont les trous noirs pourraient se former dans la nature. Les étoiles naissent lorsque d'énormes nuages de poussière cosmique et d'hydrogène commencent à s'agglutiner et à se condenser sous leur propre poids gravitationnel. La gravité devient plus forte d'heure en heure à mesure que la densité croissante de la protoétoile courbe l'espace plus fortement. De plus en plus vite, l'hydrogène gazeux tombe sur lui-même dans le noyau en condensation. Plus il entre en collision, plus il devient chaud. Lorsque le noyau atteint 10 millions de degrés, les protons d'hydrogène commencent à fusionner en hélium. Une partie de la masse disparaît, ayant été transformée en énergie et en lumière. Comme une ampoule cosmique géante, l'étoile s'est allumée.

Chaque étoile que nous voyons dans le ciel a une réaction nucléaire géante qui fait rage en son cœur. C'est ce qui fait qu'une étoile comme notre soleil brille si chaud et si brillant. La gravité essaie toujours de tirer le gaz de l'étoile de plus en plus serré, mais elle est maintenant équilibrée par l'énergie qui s'écoule vers l'extérieur depuis la réaction nucléaire du noyau. L'étoile s'installe dans un équilibre précaire que la gravité finira toujours par gagner.

## LA GRANDE COMPRESSION

Le destin ultime d'une étoile dépend de sa masse. Notre soleil est d'âge moyen. Il s'est allumé il y a 5 milliards d'années et a assez de combustible pour brûler encore 5 milliards d'années. Mais lorsque, dans ce futur lointain, le cœur épuisé du soleil perdra ses couches externes et s'éteindra, la gravité comprimera le noyau si fort qu'il ne pourra plus être comprimé. Il deviendra une "naine blanche", une braise faible de la taille de la Terre mais cent mille fois plus dense.

Plus l'étoile est massive, plus elle brûle rapidement son combustible et plus son espérance de vie est courte. Une étoile 10 fois plus massive que le soleil peut survivre seulement des millions, et non des milliards, d'années. Lorsqu'elle commence à s'effondrer, l'écrasement de la matière qui tombe et heurte le noyau de fer fait monter la température à 50 milliards de degrés. Le noyau n'a que quelques secondes pour réagir - et il le fait à la manière d'une Supernova.

Une supernova est une explosion massive. D'énormes quantités de matière sont soufflées dans l'espace, mais seulement depuis les régions extérieures de l'étoile. La majeure partie de l'étoile a en fait implosé, le noyau recevant une étreinte gravitationnelle si extrême que les protons et les électrons ont été comprimés en une boule de particules subatomiques superdenses appelées neutrons. L'"étoile à neutrons" résultante pèserait environ une fois et demie la masse du soleil mais mesurerait seulement environ 20 kilomètres de diamètre - à peu près la taille de Brisbane.

Les astronomes peuvent prouver que les étoiles à neutrons existent, car elles émettent un signal de détresse unique. Comme un phare avertissant d'une côte dangereuse, une étoile à neutrons balaie l'espace avec un faisceau aveuglant de rayonnement, généré par un champ magnétique plus de mille milliards de fois plus grand que celui de la Terre. Une telle étoile à neutrons est appelée pulsar. Pour les astronomes, le faisceau pulsant balayant l'obscurité de l'espace est un avertissement indubitable qu'une gravité extrême se cache à proximité.

## LE TRIOMPHE FINAL DE LA GRAVITÉ

Une étoile à neutrons résiste à l'écrasement continu de la gravité, seulement avec ses neutrons tassés comme des sardines en boîte. Mais si les restes de l'étoile après la supernova pèsent plus de trois fois la masse du soleil, même les neutrons ne peuvent retenir la force inexorable de la gravité. Les neutrons sont écrasés dans l'oubli. Le noyau de l'étoile devient si dense que la gravité submerge l'espace lui-même, le déformant si horriblement qu'il, et le temps avec lui, est arraché de l'univers extérieur. Une obscurité se forme au cœur de l'étoile et se déplace inexorablement vers l'extérieur alors que la brillance de l'étoile est aspirée vers l'intérieur. C'est la gueule affamée et grandissante d'un trou noir : le triomphe final de la gravité. Il n'y a pas d'échappatoire, pas de retour en arrière, jusqu'à ce que toute la masse de l'étoile ait été avalée et que sa brillance soit complètement éteinte.

## UN NOIR AU-DELÀ DU NOIR

Visible seulement par son invisibilité, la marge du trou noir est marquée par l'horizon des événements, ainsi nommé parce que tous les événements au-delà sont cachés à la vue. Pour un trou noir comme celui-ci, l'horizon des événements peut n'avoir que quelques kilomètres de diamètre, mais le vide au-delà est d'une profondeur impossible à mesurer. Toute la masse de l'étoile a été réduite à une singularité - un point de petitesse infinie et de densité infinie au centre même de cette noirceur maléfique.

La singularité est l'endroit où la science s'arrête et où la spéculation commence. L'espace et le temps ont cessé d'exister, remplacés par une masse bouillonnante et chaotique que nous appelons mousse quantique. Cette conjecture bizarre est l'endroit où les lois d'Einstein échouent. C'est là que les lois de la mécanique quantique échouent. C'est le domaine de quelque chose appelé Gravité Quantique - l'un des domaines les plus brûlants de la recherche mathématique avancée.

C'est d'une singularité que l'on croit que l'Univers a commencé. À bien des égards, l'effondrement d'une étoile pour former une singularité de trou noir est l'inverse du Big Bang. Est-ce ainsi que l'Univers va finir ? Une spéculation plus audacieuse est que notre univers entier pourrait se cacher à l'intérieur de la singularité de quelqu'un d'autre. Ou même que les univers peuvent bourgeonner les uns des autres comme cela, comme une sorte d'organisme de reproduction céleste.

Ce n'est qu'en 1967 que John Archibald Wheeler glissa le terme "Trou Noir" dans son article lors d'une conférence scientifique, et dans le lexique de la fin du 20e siècle. Ils sont peut-être devenus un nom familier - mais sont-ils réels ?

## TROU NOIR OU ÉLÉPHANT BLANC

Einstein lui-même ne pouvait croire qu'une telle impossibilité invisible comme un trou noir puisse exister dans l'univers réel au-delà de ses théories. Aujourd'hui, ses successeurs n'ont pas de tels problèmes. Les astronomes pensent non seulement avoir identifié près de 30 candidats trous noirs dans notre propre galaxie de la Voie Lactée, mais ils obtiennent maintenant la preuve que les trous se comportent de la manière relativiste que prédisent les théories d'Einstein.

Un trou noir est une proie insaisissable avec un camouflage parfait : un noir total dans la noirceur de l'espace. Chercher un trou noir pas plus grand que le centre-ville de Sydney à travers des centaines ou des milliers d'années-lumière d'espace exige une approche sournoise. D'abord, vous devez trouver une étoile visible qu'un trou noir a piégée en orbite. Ensuite, vous devez étudier comment l'étoile vacille. John Wheeler l'a décrit comme chercher une paire de danseurs sur une piste de danse sombre. L'homme lourd vêtu de noir est invisible, mais la robe blanche brillante d'une femme légère est une cible facile alors qu'elle est tourbillonnée. Les astronomes recherchent les étoiles brillantes qui "orbitent" des partenaires sombres de la même manière.

L'un des meilleurs candidats est l'étoile appelée V404 Cygni. Les calculs montrent que le partenaire sombre de V404 est douze fois plus massif que notre Soleil, mais totalement invisible. Mais pour chaque trou noir en orbite autour d'une autre étoile, il doit y en avoir beaucoup d'autres solitaires encore invisibles. L'un d'eux pourrait se cacher tranquillement beaucoup plus près de chez nous.

## L'ASPIRATEUR COSMIQUE

Bien que les trous noirs aient le pouvoir d'aspirer tout et n'importe quoi qui s'approche trop près, ils ne peuvent pas chasser. Contrairement à la croyance populaire, si vous remplaciez notre Soleil par un trou noir de même masse, la Terre ne serait pas aspirée, il n'y aurait simplement plus de lumière du soleil. Vous pourriez même orbiter autour d'un trou noir dans un vaisseau spatial tant que vous gardez une distance de sécurité.

Si vous vous approchez trop, cependant, des choses étranges commencent à se produire. L'espace s'étire en longueur et s'amincit. Vous trouveriez vos pieds tirés à des kilomètres devant vous tandis que votre corps est comprimé latéralement. Vous serez devenu un morceau de spaghettis spatial bien avant d'atteindre l'horizon des événements. Ensuite, vous seriez rompu en vos propres particules fondamentales et disparaîtriez derrière le voile des ténèbres.

Ce serait une façon spectaculaire de partir, mais personne ne le verrait parce que le temps s'étire aussi. Les photons portant l'image auraient plus de mal à quitter votre corps plus vous tombez. Même avec quelques millions d'années à perdre, un observateur extérieur vous verra ralentir jusqu'à l'arrêt au-dessus de l'horizon des événements, avant de disparaître lentement de la vue.

## CŒURS DE TÉNÈBRES

La plupart des astronomes concèdent maintenant qu'un poids lourd de trou noir se cache au centre de notre propre galaxie de la Voie Lactée. Les dernières estimations sont qu'il pèse un énorme 2 millions de fois la masse du soleil - un nain en comparaison de certains des trous noirs vraiment supermassifs qui peuvent se cacher dans le cosmos.

Dans les années 1950, les astronomes ont commencé à tourner les télescopes optiques vers certains des signaux les plus forts que les nouveaux radiotélescopes captaient. La source numéro 3C 273 s'est avérée être un objet brillant semblable à une étoile avec un "jet" de rayonnement intense qui en sortait. C'était le premier d'un certain nombre d'objets similaires nommés "quasar" ou "source radio quasi-stellaire", mais leur véritable identité est restée cachée pendant des décennies.

Les quasars se sont maintenant révélés être les cœurs énergétiques de galaxies très actives : des disques brillants de gaz surchauffé et d'étoiles déchirées tourbillonnant à près de la vitesse de la lumière. De grands jets de particules chargées sont projetés à des milliers d'années-lumière dans l'espace depuis le haut et le bas - comme un essieu à travers une roue. Le moteur central qui anime toute cette activité, cependant, est caché profondément à l'intérieur. Il doit être petit et extraordinairement dense. Les mathématiques exigent que la seule bête capable de produire un tel étalage de puissance brute soit un trou noir supermassif. Plus le trou est lourd, plus les gaz tourbillonnent rapidement en orbite. Les astronomes ont observé des vitesses qui correspondent à des trous noirs pesant jusqu'à cinq mille millions de soleils.

La théorie est la suivante : une galaxie évolue à partir d'un vaste nuage de gaz en rotation qui commence à s'agglutiner et à se condenser sous son propre poids en milliards d'étoiles disposées comme une énorme roue de Catherine, un sombrero mexicain ou un essaim d'abeilles. Au centre, où le gaz est concentré, assez de matière pour faire des millions ou même des milliards d'étoiles a subi un effondrement gravitationnel titanesque pour faire un trou noir supermassif. Pendant que le trou se nourrit encore activement de la partie intérieure de la nouvelle galaxie, il se manifeste comme un quasar. Plus tard, lorsque toute la nourriture proche a été consommée, le trou noir devient quiescent, laissant un noyau galactique relativement calme comme celui de la Voie Lactée. Si cette théorie est correcte, alors les trous noirs supermassifs sont présents dans toutes les galaxies sauf les plus petites.

## VERS L'INTÉRIEUR

Malgré toute leur férocité, ces trous noirs supermassifs sont des géants étonnamment doux de près. Vous pouvez tomber dans l'un d'eux sans vous transformer en spaghettis.

Supposons que vous ou moi soyons un astronaute sur le point de franchir un tel abîme au bord de l'univers. Alors que j'approche de l'horizon des événements, la noirceur s'étend autour de moi vers le haut. L'Univers rétrécit en un point brillant directement au-dessus. Alors que je rencontre et franchis l'horizon, l'univers au-dessus disparaît dans un flash aveuglant de photons piégés en orbite autour du trou.

Je suis maintenant à l'intérieur du trou noir et je tombe vers la Singularité. Ce n'est pas sombre comme je m'y attendais. Je vois un anneau de lumière dansante là où devrait être la singularité. Elle doit tourner si vite que la force centrifuge a équilibré la gravité. Maintenant, c'est un cerceau lumineux nu de taille indéterminée. Autour, j'aperçois des aperçus de cieux inimaginables pour les humains, des univers dans des univers, le temps dans le temps...

Mais hé ! Peu importe ce que je pourrais voir ou vivre à l'intérieur du trou noir, je ne pourrais jamais envoyer de message. Les secrets que je découvrirai mourront avec moi alors que j'atteins l'unité avec l'Univers, à la Singularité centrale.`,

        body: `ثم جاء ألبرت أينشتاين وأخبرنا أن الفضاء نفسه منحني. الآن ندرك أنه إذا أبحرنا في بحر الفضاء المنحني الذي نسميه الكون، فهناك بالفعل فراغات لا قاع لها يمكن أن يقع فيها المسافر غير الحذر - وهي لا تقاس بالنسبة للبشر. تكمن على الجانب الآخر من آفاقها المظلمة الخاصة، ونسميها الثقوب السوداء.

## جذب قاتل

الثقب الأسود هو تناقض فلكي - نجم مظلم، لا شيء غير مرئي، سجن للضوء. تحدد حدوده ما يسمى بأفق الحدث، كرة من الظلام تغلف الداخل وتحدد نقطة اللاعودة. لا يوجد سطح صلب بعد ذلك، مجرد دوامة جاذبية لا قاع لها قوية جداً لدرجة أنها تمتص كل شيء - حتى الضوء - إلى الداخل بلا رحمة. ينتظر النسيان في المركز على شكل التفرد، الجاذب القاتل للجاذبية.

مخبأة عن الأنظار إلى الأبد، يمثل التفرد المكان الذي تركزت فيه قوة جاذبية هائلة. كل الكتلة والضوء والطاقة التي سقطت في الثقب الأسود مضغوطة بفعل جاذبيتها الساحقة في نقطة صغيرة بلا حدود وكثيفة بلا حدود. كلما ابتلع الثقب الأسود أكثر، كلما أصبح أثقل، لكن التفرد لا يتغير أبداً. لقد طُرد الفضاء من الوجود وانضغط الزمن حتى التوقف. خطوة فوق أفق الحدث وبكل المقاصد والأغراق، لقد سقطت من حافة الكون.

## تاريخ موجز للجاذبية

تحدى مفهوم الجاذبية، هذه القوة غير المرئية التي تهيمن على حياتنا وتسحبنا أبدياً نحو الأرض، أعظم العقول البشرية منذ فترة طويلة. حتى في عصر غاليليو، كان برج بيزا يميل بشكل جيد - مثالي لإسقاط الأشياء منه. تساءل غاليليو عن سبب أن جميع الأجسام، بغض النظر عن ثقلها أو خفتها، استغرقت نفس الوقت لتسقط على الأرض. كما حيرته حركة الكواكب بالطريقة التي تتحرك بها. أدى اقتناعه بأنها تدور حول الشمس إلى وضعه تحت الإقامة الجبرية بتهمة الهرطقة. كان لا يزال يحاول تجميع أحجية الجاذبية عندما توفي في فلورنسا عام 1642.

في يوم عيد الميلاد من نفس العام، انتقلت عصا الجاذبية إلى إسحاق نيوتن، المولود ضعيفاً وبشكل مبكر في مزرعة في لينكولنشاير. بعد ثلاثة وعشرين عاماً، عاد نيوتن إلى قصر وولستهورب لانتظار انتهاء الطاعون الذي يجتاح جنوب إنجلترا. مع 18 شهراً من التفكير الهادئ في الريف، اكتشف حساب التفاضل والتكامل، وفكك طبيعة الضوء، وبدأ في صياغة قوانين لحركة الكواكب: اكتشافات لا تزال تشكل أساس معظم الفيزياء الحديثة. في أحد الأيام عندما كان يأخذ استراحة قصيرة مع كوب من الشاي، قطعت تفكيره تفاحة متساقطة وقادته إلى التفكير في الجاذبية نفسها.

كان سبب سقوط التفاحة مباشرة إلى الأسفل هو أنها كانت تحاول السقوط إلى مركز الأرض حيث تركز الجاذبية. ولم تكن الأرض هي الجسم الوحيد الذي له جاذبية، وكذلك القمر والشمس والكواكب. في الواقع، استنتج نيوتن، كل جسم في الكون - بما فينا نحن - له جاذبية. كلما كان الجسم أكبر وأثقل، زادت قوة جاذبيته. نحن ملتصقون بسطح الأرض - وليس العكس - فقط لأن لديها كتلة أكبر بكثير. تدور الأرض حول الشمس لنفس السبب. أخيراً، وجد نيوتن سبباً لتحرك السماوات بالطريقة التي تتحرك بها.

## النجوم المظلمة

في عام 1784، أصبح جون ميشيل، قس كنيسة ثورنهيل في يوركشاير والعالم العظيم المنسي في القرن الثامن عشر، مفتوناً بفكرة سرعة الهروب - السرعة الدنيا التي تحتاجها للسفر للأعلى من نجم أو كوكب للهروب من قبضته الجاذبية. كان يعلم أن الجاذبية تعتمد على الكتلة وكان يعلم أن سرعة الضوء سريعة ولكنها محدودة. كم، تساءل، يجب أن يثقل الشمس قبل أن تصبح جاذبيتها عظيمة جداً لدرجة أن الضوء (الذي يسافر بسرعة 299,792 كم/ثانية) سيكون محجوزاً عند سطحها؟ الجواب، استنتج ميشيل، هو أنه إذا كانت الشمس بنفس الحجم ولكن وزنها 500 مرة أكثر، فإن ضوء الشمس لن يهرب من جاذبية الشمس نفسها. ستختفي الشمس ببساطة عن الأنظار. بعد بضع سنوات، توصل عالم الرياضيات الفرنسي العظيم لابلاس إلى نفس الاستنتاج بشكل مستقل. ولد مفهوم النجم المظلم.

## كون من الثقوب

ظلت الثقوب السوداء فضولاً نظرياً مُتجاهلاً حتى نشر موظف صغير في مكتب براءات الاختراع السويسري نظريته النسبية العامة في عام 1915. أدرك ألبرت أينشتاين أن الكون كان مكاناً مختلفاً جوهرياً عن كون نيوتن الميكانيكي والمنطق السليم. لا يمكن فصل الأبعاد الثلاثة للفضاء عن البعد الرابع، الزمن. معاً يشكلون استمرارية "الزمكان"، نوع من السقالات غير المرئية التي تحدد الوجود. ومع ذلك، فإن الزمكان ليس شيئاً مطلقاً وثابتاً. يمكن أن يلتوي وينحني وينحني.

يكون الزمكان "مستقيماً" فقط عندما لا يكون فيه أي شيء. أينما توجد كتلة، توجد جاذبية. أينما توجد جاذبية، يكون الفضاء منحنياً. انحناء الفضاء يحدد كيف سيتحرك الجسم من خلاله. سيحدد الجسم كيف ينحني الفضاء حوله. الجاذبية، وفقاً لأينشتاين، هي انحناء الفضاء.

كانت تجربة أينشتاين الفكرية هي تخيل الفضاء والزمن مضغوطين بشكل مسطح مثل ورقة مطاطية ثنائية الأبعاد. ضع جسماً ضخماً مثل الشمس على الورقة وسوف تنحني. كلما زادت كثافة الجسم، زاد عمق الاكتئاب الذي يحدثه في الزمكان وكلما كانت الجاذبية أقوى. في النهاية، يتم الوصول إلى نقطة حيث تمتد جدران الاكتئاب بشكل شديد الانحدار بحيث لا يمكن لأي شيء الخروج منها. إنها، حرفياً، ثقب في الكون.

## ولد نجم

لفهم الكبير جداً في الكون، تحتاج إلى البدء بالصغير جداً. مع كشف أسرار الطاقة النووية، حصل العلماء أخيراً على دليل حول كيفية تشكل الثقوب السوداء في الطبيعة. تولد النجوم عندما تبدأ سحب هائلة من الغبار الكوني والهيدروجين في التكتل والتكثف تحت وزنها الجاذبي. تزداد الجاذبية قوة ساعة بعد ساعة مع زيادة كثافة النجم الأولي التي تنحني الفضاء بقوة أكبر. أسرع فأسرع، يسقط غاز الهيدروجين على نفسه في النواة المتكثفة. كلما تصادم أكثر، زادت سخونته. عندما تصل النواة إلى 10 ملايين درجة، تبدأ بروتونات الهيدروجين في الاندماج لتكوين الهيليوم. تختفي بعض الكتلة، بعد أن تحولت إلى طاقة وضوء. مثل مصباح كوني عملاق، أضاء النجم نفسه.

كل نجم نراه في السماء له تفاعل نووي ضخم يشتعل في قلبه. هذا ما يجعل نجماً مثل شمسنا يلمع بحرارة ولمعان. لا تزال الجاذبية تحاول سحب غاز النجم بإحكام أكثر فأكثر ولكنها تقابل الآن بالطاقة المتدفقة للخارج من التفاعل النووي في القلب. يستقر النجم في توازن محفوف بالمخاطر ستفوز فيه الجاذبية دائماً في النهاية.

## الضغط الكبير

المصير النهائي للنجم يعتمد على كتلته. شمسنا في منتصف العمر. أضاءت قبل 5 مليارات سنة ولديها وقود كافٍ لتحترق لمدة 5 مليارات أخرى. ولكن عندما، في ذلك المستقبل البعيد، يتخلص قلب الشمس المنهك من طبقاته الخارجية ويتوقف، ستضغط الجاذبية النواة بشدة لدرجة أنه لا يمكن ضغطها أكثر. ستصبح "قزماً أبيض"، جمرة ضعيفة بحجم الأرض ولكن أكثر كثافة بمائة ألف مرة.

كلما كان النجم أكثر ضخامة، كلما احترق وقوده بشكل أسرع وكانت مدة حياته أقصر. قد ينجو نجم كتلته 10 أضعاف كتلة الشمس لملايين السنين فقط، وليس مليارات. عندما يبدأ في الانهيار، يرسل سحق المادة المتساقطة التي تصطدم بنواة الحديد درجة الحرارة إلى 50 مليار درجة. لا تملك النواة سوى ثوانٍ للاستجابة - وهي تفعل ذلك بأسلوب المستعر الأعظم.

المستعر الأعظم هو انفجار ضخم. تُنفَث كميات هائلة من المواد في الفضاء، ولكن فقط من المناطق الخارجية للنجم. معظم النجم قد انهار بالفعل داخلياً، حيث تم احتضان النواة من قبل الجاذبية بشكل متطرف لدرجة أن البروتونات والإلكترونات قد تم ضغطها في كرة من الجسيمات دون الذرية فائقة الكثافة تسمى النيوترونات. "النجم النيوتروني" الناتج سيزن حوالي مرة ونصف كتلة الشمس ولكن سيكون قطره حوالي 20 كيلومتراً فقط - بحجم بريسبان تقريباً.

يمكن لعلماء الفلك إثبات وجود النجوم النيوترونية، لأنها تطلق إشارة استغاثة فريدة. مثل منارة تحذر من ساحل خطير، يجتاح النجم النيوتروني الفضاء بحزمة عمياء من الإشعاع، يتم توليدها بواسطة مجال مغناطيسي أكبر بأكثر من تريليون مرة من مجال الأرض. يسمى مثل هذا النجم النيوتروني بالنجم النابض. لعلماء الفلك، الحزمة النابضة التي تجتاح ظلام الفضاء هي تحذير لا لبس فيه بأن الجاذبية المتطرفة تكمن في الجوار.

## انتصار الجاذبية النهائي

يقاوم النجم النيوتروني السحق المستمر للجاذبية، فقط مع نيوتروناته معبأة مثل السردين في علبة. ولكن إذا كان وزن بقايا النجم بعد المستعر الأعظم أكثر من ثلاثة أضعاف كتلة الشمس، حتى النيوترونات لا يمكنها ردع القوة الجبارة للجاذبية. يتم سحق النيوترونات إلى النسيان. تصبح نواة النجم كثيفة جداً لدرجة أن الجاذبية تطغى على الفضاء نفسه، مشوهة إياه بشكل فظيع بحيث يتم انتزاعه، والزمن معه، عن الكون الخارجي. يتشكل ظلام في قلب النجم ويتحرك بلا رحمة نحو الخارج بينما تُسحب بريقة النجم إلى الداخل. هذا هو فم الثقب الأسود الجائع والمتنامي: انتصار الجاذبية النهائي. لا يوجد مفر، ولا عودة، حتى يتم ابتلاع كتلة النجم بأكملها وانطفاء بريقها تماماً.

## سواد يتجاوز السواد

مرئي فقط من خلال عدم رؤيته، تحدد هامش الثقب الأسود أفق الحدث، يسمى بذلك لأن جميع الأحداث وراءه مخفية عن الأنظار. لثقب أسود مثل هذا، قد يكون قطر أفق الحدث بضعة كيلومترات فقط ولكن الفراغ بعده عميق بشكل مستحيل القياس. تم اختزال كتلة النجم بأكملها إلى تفرد - نقطة من الصغر اللانهائي والكثافة اللانهائية في مركز هذا الشر الأسود.

التفرد هو المكان الذي تنتهي فيه العلم ويبدأ التكهن. لقد توقف المكان والزمن عن الوجود، وحل محلهما كتلة فوضوية مغلية نسميها رغوة الكم. هذا التكهن الغريب هو المكان الذي تفشل فيه قوانين أينشتاين. هذا هو المكان الذي تفشل فيه قوانين ميكانيكا الكم. هذا هو عالم شيء يسمى الجاذبية الكمية - واحدة من أكثر مجالات البحث الرياضي المتقدم سخونة.

يُعتقد أن الكون بدأ من تفرد. من نواح كثيرة، انهيار نجم لتشكيل تفرد ثقب أسود هو عكس الانفجار العظيم. هل هذه هي الطريقة التي سينتهي بها الكون؟ تكهن أكثر جرأة هو أن كوننا بأكمله قد يكمن داخل تفرد شخص آخر. أو حتى أن الأكوان يمكن أن تبرعم من بعضها البعض بهذه الطريقة، مثل نوع من الكائنات السماوية المتكاثرة.

لم يكن حتى عام 1967 أن انزلق جون أرتشيبالد ويلر بمصطلح "الثقب الأسود" في ورقته في مؤتمر علمي، وإلى معجم أواخر القرن العشرين. ربما أصبحت اسماً مألوفاً - لكن هل هي حقيقية؟

## ثقب أسود أم فيل أبيض

لم يستطع أينشتاين نفسه أن يصدق أن استحالة غير مرئية مثل الثقب الأسود يمكن أن توجد في الكون الحقيقي خارج نظرياته. اليوم، ليس لدى خلفائه مثل هذه المشاكل. لا يعتقد علماء الفلك أنهم حددوا ما يقرب من 30 مرشحاً للثقب الأسود في مجرتنا درب التبانة فحسب، بل يحصلون الآن على دليل على أن الثقوب تتصرف بالطريقة النسبية التي تتنبأ بها نظريات أينشتاين.

الثقب الأسود هو فريسة بعيدة المنال مع تمويه مثالي: سواد تام في سواد الفضاء. يتطلب البحث عن ثقب أسود لا يزيد حجمه عن وسط مدينة سيدني عبر مئات أو آلاف السنين الضوئية من الفضاء نهجاً متستراً. أولاً، عليك العثور على نجم مرئي احتضنه ثقب أسود في مداره. ثم عليك دراسة كيف يترنح النجم. وصفه جون ويلر بأنه يشبه البحث عن زوج من الراقصين على أرضية رقص مظلمة. الرجل الثقيل يرتدي اللون الأسود غير مرئي، لكن فستان المرأة الخفيف الأبيض اللامع هو هدف سهل بينما تدور حولها. يبحث علماء الفلك عن النجوم اللامعة التي "تدور" حول شركاء مظلمين بنفس الطريقة.

أحد أفضل المرشحين هو النجم المسمى V404 Cygni. تظهر الحسابات أن الشريك المظلم لـ V404 أثقل باثني عشر مرة من شمسنا، ولكنه غير مرئي تماماً. ولكن مقابل كل ثقب أسود يدور حول نجم آخر، يجب أن يكون هناك الكثير من الثقوب المنفردة غير المرئية بعد. يمكن لأحد هذه الثقوب أن يكمن بهدوء أقرب بكثير من المنزل.

## المكنسة الكونية

على الرغم من أن الثقوب السوداء لديها القدرة على شفط أي شيء وكل شيء يقترب أكثر من اللازم، إلا أنها لا تستطيع الصيد. على عكس الاعتقاد الشائع، إذا استبدلت شمسنا بثقب أسود بنفس الكتلة، فلن تُشفط الأرض، ببساطة لن يكون هناك ضوء الشمس. يمكنك حتى الدوران حول ثقب أسود في مركبة فضائية طالما حافظت على مسافة آمنة.

لكن إذا اقتربت أكثر من اللازم، تبدأ أشياء غريبة في الحدوث. يتمدد الفضاء ويصبح أطول وأرفع. ستجد أن قدميك تُسحبان لأميال أمامك بينما يتم ضغط جسمك جانبياً. ستصبح قطعة من السباغيتي الفضائي قبل وقت طويل من وصولك إلى أفق الحدث. ثم ستنفجر إلى جسيماتك الأساسية وتختفي وراء حجاب الظلام.

ستكون طريقة مذهلة للرحيل ولكن لن يرها أحد لأن الوقت يتمدد أيضاً. سيكافح الفوتونات التي تحمل الصورة لمغادرة جسمك كلما اقتربت من السقوط. حتى مع وجود بضعة ملايين من السنين الاحتياطية، سيراك مراقب خارجي تتباطأ حتى التوقف فوق أفق الحدث، قبل أن تتلاشى ببطء من الأنظار.

## قلوب الظلام

يقر معظم علماء الفلك الآن بأن ثقباً أسود ضخماً يكمن في مركز مجرتنا درب التبانة. تشير أحدث التقديرات إلى أن وزنه يبلغ 2 مليون مرة كتلة الشمس - وهو قزم مقارنة ببعض الثقوب السوداء فائقة الكتلة الحقيقية التي قد تكمن في الكون.

بحلول الخمسينيات من القرن الماضي، بدأ علماء الفلك في توجيه التلسكوبات البصرية نحو بعض أقوى الإشارات التي كانت تلتقطها التلسكوبات الراديوية الجديدة. وجد أن المصدر رقم 3C 273 هو جسم ساطع يشبه النجم مع "نفاثة" من الإشعاع الشديد تبرز منه. كان الأول من عدد من الأجسام المماثلة التي أعطيت اسم "الكوازار" أو "المصدر الراديوي شبه النجمي"، لكن هويتهم الحقيقية بقيت مخفية لعقود.

تم الكشف الآن عن أن الكوازارات هي القلوب النشطة للمجرات النشطة للغاية: أقراص لامعة من الغاز فائق السخونة والنجوم المنفجرة تدور بسرعة تقارب سرعة الضوء. تنفجر نفاثات كبيرة من الجسيمات المشحونة لآلاف السنين الضوئية في الفضاء من أعلى وأسفل - مثل محور عبر عجلة. لكن المحرك المركزي الذي يقود كل هذا النشاط مخفي في الأعماق. يجب أن يكون صغيراً ويجب أن يكون كثيفاً بشكل غير عادي. تطلب الرياضيات أن الوحش الوحيد الذي يمكنه قيادة مثل هذا العرض من القوة الخام هو ثقب أسود فائق الكتلة. كلما كان الثقب أثقل، زادت سرعة دوران الغازات في المدار. لاحظ علماء الفلك سرعات تتوافق مع ثقوب سوداء تصل كتلتها إلى خمسة آلاف مليون شمس.

تذهب النظرية هكذا: تتطور المجرة من سحابة غاز دوارة شاسعة تبدأ في التكتل والتكثف تحت وزنها إلى مليارات النجوم مرتبة مثل عجلة كاثرين هائلة، أو قبعة مكسيكية، أو سرب نحل. في المركز، حيث يتركز الغاز، خضعت مادة كافية لصنع ملايين أو حتى مليارات النجوم لانهيار جاذبي عملاق لتكوين ثقب أسود فائق الكتلة. بينما لا يزال الثقب يتغذى بنشاط على الجزء الداخلي من المجرة الجديدة، يظهر نفسه ككوازار. لاحقاً، عندما يتم استهلاك كل الطعام القريب، يصبح الثقب الأسود هادئاً، تاركاً نواة مجرية هادئة نسبياً مثل تلك الموجودة في درب التبانة. إذا كانت هذه النظرية صحيحة، فإن الثقوب السوداء فائقة الكتلة موجودة في جميع المجرات باستثناء الأصغر.

## نحو الداخل

على الرغم من كل شراستهم، فإن هذه الثقوب السوداء فائقة الكتلة هي عمالقة لطيفون بشكل مدهش من قرب. يمكنك السقوط في أحدها دون أن تتحول إلى سباغيتي.

لنفترض أنك أو أنا رائد فضاء على وشك خطو مثل هذا الهاوية على حافة الكون. بينما أقترب من أفق الحدث، ينتشر السواد حولي نحو الأعلى. يتقلص الكون إلى نقطة لامعة مباشرة فوق الرأس. بينما ألتقي وأعبر الأفق، يختفي الكون أعلاه في ومضة عمياء من الفوتونات المحاصرة في مدار حول الثقب.

أنا الآن داخل الثقب الأسود وأسقط نحو التفرد. إنه ليس مظلماً كما توقعت. أرى حلقة من الضوء الراقص حيث يجب أن يكون التفرد. يجب أن يدور بسرعة كبيرة لدرجة أن القوة الطاردة المركزية وازنت الجاذبية. الآن إنه طوق هوولاهوب مضيء عاري بحجم غير محدد. حوله ألقي لمحات من سماوات لا يمكن تخيلها للبشر، أكوان داخل أكوان، زمن داخل زمن...

ولكن مهلاً! بغض النظر عما قد أراه أو أختبره داخل الثقب الأسود، لا يمكنني أبداً إرسال رسالة للخارج. الأسرار التي اكتشفها ستموت معي عندما أحقق الوحدة مع الكون، في التفرد المركزي.`,

        title: 'Jupiter\'s Galilean moons complete guide',
        author: 'Iain Todd, Brian Jones',
        introduction: 'Jupiter\'s Galilean moons are its four largest satellites Io, Callisto, Europa and Ganymede.',
        excerpt: 'Facts about and images of Jupiter\'s four largest satellites, the Galilean moons.',
        body: `Jupiter's Galilean moons are its four largest satellites Io, Callisto, Europa and Ganymede.

They're known as the Galilean moons because the first recorded observation was by Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei in 1610.

The Galilean moons are fascinating worlds. Ganymede, for example, is the largest moon in the Solar System.

Io is the most volcanically active world in the Solar System, its volcanoes having been discovered by planetary scientist Linda Morabito during the Voyager mission.

Europa is an icy moon with a subsurface ocean lurking beneath its frozen crust, much like Saturn's moon Enceladus.

As a result, it's one of the best places in the Solar System to search for conditions that could support life.

Callisto is the third largest moon in the Solar System, after Saturn's moon Titan, and may be considered by some to be the lifeless, characterless member of the four Galilean moons.

However, there is evidence that Callisto too hosts a subsurface ocean. Could it be another contender for life-supporting conditions beyond Earth?

## How the Galilean moons formed

It is thought that Jupiter's largest moons Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto most probably formed out of material leftover from the formation of Jupiter itself.

Like the rest of the Solar System planets, Jupiter formed out of the disc of dust and gas surrounding the young Sun. Once this gas and dust had condensed to form Jupiter, the leftover material coalesced and grew over time to form the Galilean moons.

This makes Jupiter's largest moons likely as old of the rest of the Solar System: about 4.5 billion years old.

## Observing Jupiter's Galilean moons

The Galilean moons are also a favourite target of astronomers because it is possible to view them around Jupiter, provided you have a big enough telescope.

If you know when and where to look, you may be able to see transits of the moons passing Jupiter, spot their shadows cast on the gas giant's surface, or even an occultation.

## Io

**Diameter:** 3,660km
**Mass:** 0.015 Earth masses
**Orbital distance:** 421,800km
**Equatorial circumference:** 11,445.5km

Io is the most volcanically active body in the solar system, hosting hundreds of volcanoes that are kept active by the gravitational interactions between the moon, Jupiter, and fellow Jovian satellites Europa and Ganymede.

It has a highly elliptical orbit, and tidal forces generated through its interaction with Jupiter generate a fierce amount of heat that causes molten lava to spew from volcanoes, filling surface impact craters.

Jupiter's magnetic field strips material from Io's surface, producing a cloud of radiation around the volcanic moon.

As a result of all these processes, Io is an incredibly dynamic world, and perhaps one of the oddest looking moons in the Solar System.

According to Linda Morabito, when Voyager scientists got their first glimpse of Io, they described it as looking like 'mouldy pizza'.

## Europa

**Diameter:** 3,122km
**Mass:** 0.008 Earth masses
**Orbital distance:** 670,900km
**Equatorial circumference:** 9,807km

The smallest of the moons, Europa is an icy world known to have a liquid ocean beneath its 15-25km thick icy crust, which may contain twice as much as all of Earth's oceans combined.

This makes it a promising place to search for life, and this is exactly what missions JUICE - JUpiter ICy moons Explorer - and Europa Clipper will be doing.

Images of Europa reveal long, linear fractures and rusty red-brown material that could be salty, sulphuric compounds that have mixed with water ice and been blasted by radiation.

Its surface is young, potentially as young as 40 million years old, which is evinced by the very small number of craters that can be seen.

Studies using the Hubble Space Telescope have revealed that Europa might actually be venting water from its subsurface ocean out into space, which would be prime targets for future missions to explore Europa, just like the Cassini spacecraft at Saturn's moon Enceladus.

## Ganymede

**Diameter:** 5,268km
**Mass:** 0.025 Earth masses
**Orbital distance:** 1,070,400km
**Equatorial circumference:** 16,532km

Ganymede is quite a specimen. It's the largest moon in the Solar System and the only moon orbiting the Sun with its own magnetic field. As a result it has aurorae at its north and south poles.

It is thought to have a large rocky core covered with layers of ice and water, which show signs of tectonic activity.

The surface of Ganymede seems to have two types of terrain: dark cratered areas and lighter terrain sporting cracks and grooves.

These grooves can stretch 700 metres high and could be a result of tensional faulting, or it could be that Ganymede has a subsurface ocean that's releasing water into space.

## Callisto

**Diameter:** 4,821km
**Mass:** 0.018 Earth masses
**Orbital distance:** 1,882,700km
**Equatorial circumference:** 15,144km

Callisto is Jupiter's second largest moon and perhaps the dark horse of the Galilean satellites. It seems to be a geologically inactive, dark, cratered world, but planetary scientists believe it could host a liquid ocean beneath its surface.

That's not to diminish what's going on at the surface, however. Callisto's surface is about 4 billion years old - a result of its geological inertness - and thought to be the oldest, most cratered surface in the Solar System.

The bright spots that pepper Callisto's surface might well be water ice, frozen on the peaks of its many craters.

Callisto's subsurface ocean could be interacting with a layer of rocks 250km deep, and oxygen has been detected in the moon's exosphere.

Could Callisto be a key player in the search for life in the Solar System?

## Discovery of the Galilean moons

On the title page of Galileo's Sidereus Nuncius (Sidereal Messenger) – the first astronomical work based on telescope observations when it was published in 1610 – the author says that the book introduces the reader to "great and surpassingly wondrous sights… observed by Galileo Galilei, Florentine patrician and public mathematician at the University of Padua… in four planets revolving with remarkable speed at differing distances and periods around the star Jupiter.

They have been known to no one up to this day, and the author was the first to discover them. He has decided to call them the Medicean planets."

The initial naming of the moons as the Medicean planets was to acknowledge the patronage he received from Grand Duke Cosimo II de' Medici of Tuscany (1590–1621), whom Galileo had served as mathematics tutor in 1605.

Galileo's first idea was to name the newly discovered moons the Cosmica Sidera (Cosmian Stars) solely in honour of his patron, but ultimately chose a name that honoured all four surviving Medici brothers: Cosimo, Francesco, Carlo and Lorenzo.

Galileo also recognised that the four objects he had observed through his telescope were the first ever seen to orbit another planet, and the importance of his discovery was not lost on him.

But though he may have been the first to name them, Galileo's claim to having been the first to see them has come under some doubt.

It has been suggested that the Chinese astronomer Gan De, who carried out some of the earliest known systematic observations of the planets in the 4th century BC, may have seen Ganymede.

It was while he was studying Jupiter during the summer of 365 BC that Gan De recorded what he described as a 'small reddish star' next to the planet.

The Chinese astronomy historian Xi Zezong (1927-2008) suggested this may have been an early sighting of Ganymede.

It is theoretically possible to see the Galilean moons with the naked eye, but it requires near perfect conditions and incredible eyesight.

In 1614, around four years after Sidereus Nuncius was published, German astronomer Simon Marius (1753-1625) published his work Mundus Iovialis (1614) in which he described the planet Jupiter and its moons.

He laid claim to having discovered them in December 1609.

This would mean that Marius had spotted the Jovian moons some time before Galileo who, according to Sidereus Nuncius, had first seen them on 7 January 1610.

However, what is certain is that Galileo was the first to publish what he saw.

It was on that date that Galileo turned his telescope towards Jupiter and noticed what he described as "three little stars… positioned near (Jupiter) – small but yet very bright" and noting the presence of a fourth 'little star' a few days later.

Although his first thoughts were that these were 'fixed stars', Galileo was sufficiently intrigued by the fact they were "arranged exactly along a straight line and parallel to the ecliptic" to continue his observations, which ultimately revealed their true nature.

After announcing the moons in Sidereus Nuncius, independent verification and sightings of the newly discovered Jovian moons came from a number of sources.

These included such noteworthy observers as Johannes Kepler in Prague, English astronomer Thomas Harriot and French astronomer Joseph Gaultier de La Vallette.

Regardless of who saw them first the mythological names by which these satellites are known today are those given them by Marius (inspired by a suggestion from Johannes Kepler).

In 1614, he wrote in Mundus Iovialis, "Io, Europa, the boy Ganymede and Callisto greatly pleased lustful Jupiter."

However, the names didn't gain favour until the early 20th century, mainly because Galileo refused to use them.

In the meantime, Jupiter's Galilean moons were generally referred to as Jupiter I, II, III and IV according to their closeness to Jupiter.

It would be another few centuries until Jupiter's next moon, Amalthea, was discovered by American astronomer Edward Emerson Barnard using the 36-inch Great Lick Refractor at Lick Observatory on 9 September 1892.

Amalthea holds the distinction of being the last planetary satellite to be discovered by direct visual observation.

The sixth Jovian moon, Himalia, was revealed on 3 December 1904 using astrophotography, as have all of its many subsequently discovered moons.`,

Les lunes galiléennes sont des mondes fascinants. Ganymède, par exemple, est la plus grande lune du système solaire.

Io est le monde le plus volcaniquement actif du système solaire, ses volcans ayant été découverts par la scientifique planétaire Linda Morabito lors de la mission Voyager.

Europe est une lune glacée avec un océan souterrain caché sous sa croûte gelée, un peu comme Encelade, la lune de Saturne.

En conséquence, c'est l'un des meilleurs endroits du système solaire pour rechercher des conditions pouvant soutenir la vie.

Callisto est la troisième plus grande lune du système solaire, après Titan de Saturne, et peut être considérée par certains comme le membre sans vie et sans caractère des quatre lunes galiléennes.

Cependant, il existe des preuves que Callisto abrite également un océan souterrain. Pourrait-il être un autre candidat pour des conditions favorables à la vie au-delà de la Terre ?

## Comment se sont formées les lunes galiléennes

On pense que les plus grandes lunes de Jupiter, Io, Europe, Ganymède et Callisto, se sont probablement formées à partir des restes de la formation de Jupiter elle-même.

Comme le reste des planètes du système solaire, Jupiter s'est formée à partir du disque de poussière et de gaz entourant le jeune Soleil. Une fois que ce gaz et cette poussière se sont condensés pour former Jupiter, les matériaux restants se sont agglomérés et ont grandi au fil du temps pour former les lunes galiléennes.

Cela fait que les plus grandes lunes de Jupiter sont probablement aussi vieilles que le reste du système solaire : environ 4,5 milliards d'années.

## Observer les lunes galiléennes de Jupiter

Les lunes galiléennes sont également une cible préférée des astronomes car il est possible de les voir autour de Jupiter, à condition d'avoir un télescope suffisamment grand.

Si vous savez quand et où regarder, vous pourrez peut-être voir les transits des lunes passant devant Jupiter, repérer leurs ombres projetées sur la surface de la géante gazeuse, ou même une occultation.

## Io

**Diamètre :** 3 660 km
**Masse :** 0,015 masses terrestres
**Distance orbitale :** 421 800 km
**Circonférence équatoriale :** 11 445,5 km

Io est le corps le plus volcaniquement actif du système solaire, abritant des centaines de volcans maintenus actifs par les interactions gravitationnelles entre la lune, Jupiter et les autres satellites joviens Europe et Ganymède.

Elle a une orbite très elliptique, et les forces de marée générées par son interaction avec Jupiter produisent une chaleur intense qui fait jaillir de la lave en fusion des volcans, comblant les cratères d'impact de surface.

Le champ magnétique de Jupiter arrache du matériel de la surface d'Io, produisant un nuage de radiation autour de la lune volcanique.

À la suite de tous ces processus, Io est un monde incroyablement dynamique, et peut-être l'une des lunes les plus étranges du système solaire.

Selon Linda Morabito, lorsque les scientifiques de Voyager ont aperçu Io pour la première fois, ils l'ont décrite comme ressemblant à une "pizza moisie".

## Europe

**Diamètre :** 3 122 km
**Masse :** 0,008 masses terrestres
**Distance orbitale :** 670 900 km
**Circonférence équatoriale :** 9 807 km

La plus petite des lunes, Europe est un monde glacé connu pour avoir un océan liquide sous sa croûte glacée de 15 à 25 km d'épaisseur, qui pourrait contenir deux fois plus d'eau que tous les océans de la Terre réunis.

Cela en fait un endroit prometteur pour rechercher la vie, et c'est exactement ce que feront les missions JUICE (JUpiter ICy moons Explorer) et Europa Clipper.

Les images d'Europe révèlent de longues fractures linéaires et un matériau rouge-brun rouillé qui pourrait être des composés salés et sulfuriques mélangés à de la glace d'eau et bombardés par les radiations.

Sa surface est jeune, potentiellement aussi jeune que 40 millions d'années, ce qui est démontré par le très petit nombre de cratères visibles.

Des études utilisant le télescope spatial Hubble ont révélé qu'Europe pourrait en fait éjecter de l'eau de son océan souterrain dans l'espace, ce qui serait des cibles de choix pour les futures missions d'exploration d'Europe, tout comme la sonde Cassini l'a fait pour Encelade, la lune de Saturne.

## Ganymède

**Diamètre :** 5 268 km
**Masse :** 0,025 masses terrestres
**Distance orbitale :** 1 070 400 km
**Circonférence équatoriale :** 16 532 km

Ganymède est tout à fait remarquable. C'est la plus grande lune du système solaire et la seule lune en orbite autour du Soleil à posséder son propre champ magnétique. En conséquence, elle a des aurores à ses pôles nord et sud.

On pense qu'elle a un grand noyau rocheux recouvert de couches de glace et d'eau, qui présentent des signes d'activité tectonique.

La surface de Ganymède semble avoir deux types de terrain : des zones sombres et criblées de cratères et des terrains plus clairs présentant des fissures et des rainures.

Ces rainures peuvent s'élever jusqu'à 700 mètres de haut et pourraient être le résultat de failles de tension, ou il se pourrait que Ganymède ait un océan souterrain qui libère de l'eau dans l'espace.

## Callisto

**Diamètre :** 4 821 km
**Masse :** 0,018 masses terrestres
**Distance orbitale :** 1 882 700 km
**Circonférence équatoriale :** 15 144 km

Callisto est la deuxième plus grande lune de Jupiter et peut-être le cheval noir des satellites galiléens. Elle semble être un monde géologiquement inactif, sombre et criblé de cratères, mais les scientifiques planétaires pensent qu'elle pourrait abriter un océan liquide sous sa surface.

Cela ne diminue cependant pas ce qui se passe à la surface. La surface de Callisto a environ 4 milliards d'années - résultat de son inertie géologique - et serait la surface la plus ancienne et la plus cratérisée du système solaire.

Les taches claires qui parsèment la surface de Callisto pourraient bien être de la glace d'eau, gelée au sommet de ses nombreux cratères.

L'océan souterrain de Callisto pourrait interagir avec une couche de roches de 250 km de profondeur, et de l'oxygène a été détecté dans l'exosphère de la lune.

Callisto pourrait-elle être un acteur clé dans la recherche de vie dans le système solaire ?

## Découverte des lunes galiléennes

Sur la page de titre du Sidereus Nuncius (Messager des étoiles) de Galilée - le premier ouvrage astronomique basé sur des observations télescopiques lorsqu'il fut publié en 1610 - l'auteur dit que le livre présente au lecteur "des vues grandes et merveilleusement surprenantes... observées par Galilée, patricien florentin et mathématicien public de l'Université de Padoue... dans quatre planètes tournant avec une rapidité remarquable à des distances et périodes différentes autour de l'étoile Jupiter.

Elles n'ont été connues de personne jusqu'à ce jour, et l'auteur est le premier à les avoir découvertes. Il a décidé de les appeler les planètes Médicéennes."

La nomination initiale des lunes en tant que planètes Médicéennes visait à reconnaître le patronage qu'il avait reçu du grand-duc Cosimo II de Médicis de Toscane (1590-1621), que Galilée avait servi comme tuteur en mathématiques en 1605.

La première idée de Galilée était de nommer les lunes nouvellement découvertes les Cosmica Sidera (Étoiles Cosmiques) uniquement en l'honneur de son mécène, mais il a finalement choisi un nom qui honorait les quatre frères Médicis survivants : Cosimo, Francesco, Carlo et Lorenzo.

Galilée a également reconnu que les quatre objets qu'il avait observés à travers son télescope étaient les premiers jamais vus en orbite autour d'une autre planète, et l'importance de sa découverte ne lui a pas échappé.

Mais bien qu'il ait peut-être été le premier à les nommer, la revendication de Galilée d'avoir été le premier à les voir a été mise en doute.

Il a été suggéré que l'astronome chinois Gan De, qui a effectué certaines des premières observations systématiques connues des planètes au 4ème siècle avant J.-C., aurait pu voir Ganymède.

C'est alors qu'il étudiait Jupiter pendant l'été 365 avant J.-C. que Gan De a enregistré ce qu'il a décrit comme une "petite étoile rougeâtre" à côté de la planète.

L'historien de l'astronomie chinois Xi Zezong (1927-2008) a suggéré qu'il pourrait s'agir d'une première observation de Ganymède.

Il est théoriquement possible de voir les lunes galiléennes à l'œil nu, mais cela nécessite des conditions quasi parfaites et une vue incroyable.

En 1614, environ quatre ans après la publication de Sidereus Nuncius, l'astronome allemand Simon Marius (1753-1625) publie son ouvrage Mundus Iovialis (1614) dans lequel il décrit la planète Jupiter et ses lunes.

Il prétend les avoir découvertes en décembre 1609.

Cela signifierait que Marius avait repéré les lunes joviennes quelque temps avant Galilée qui, selon Sidereus Nuncius, les avait vues pour la première fois le 7 janvier 1610.

Cependant, ce qui est certain, c'est que Galilée a été le premier à publier ce qu'il a vu.

C'est à cette date que Galilée a tourné son télescope vers Jupiter et a remarqué ce qu'il a décrit comme "trois petites étoiles... positionnées près de (Jupiter) - petites mais pourtant très brillantes" et notant la présence d'une quatrième "petite étoile" quelques jours plus tard.

Bien que ses premières pensées aient été que c'étaient des "étoiles fixes", Galilée a été suffisamment intrigué par le fait qu'elles étaient "arrangées exactement le long d'une ligne droite et parallèle à l'écliptique" pour poursuivre ses observations, qui ont finalement révélé leur vraie nature.

Après avoir annoncé les lunes dans Sidereus Nuncius, la vérification indépendante et les observations des nouvelles lunes joviennes sont venues de plusieurs sources.

Celles-ci incluaient des observateurs aussi notables que Johannes Kepler à Prague, l'astronome anglais Thomas Harriot et l'astronome français Joseph Gaultier de La Vallette.

Indépendamment de qui les a vues en premier, les noms mythologiques par lesquels ces satellites sont connus aujourd'hui sont ceux donnés par Marius (inspirés par une suggestion de Johannes Kepler).

En 1614, il écrit dans Mundus Iovialis : "Io, Europe, le jeune Ganymède et Callisto ont grandement plu à Jupiter le luxurieux."

Cependant, les noms n'ont pas été favorisés jusqu'au début du 20ème siècle, principalement parce que Galilée a refusé de les utiliser.

En attendant, les lunes galiléennes de Jupiter étaient généralement désignées comme Jupiter I, II, III et IV selon leur proximité avec Jupiter.

Il faudrait encore quelques siècles pour que la lune suivante de Jupiter, Amalthée, soit découverte par l'astronome américain Edward Emerson Barnard utilisant le Great Lick Refractor de 36 pouces de l'Observatoire Lick le 9 septembre 1892.

Amalthée a la distinction d'être le dernier satellite planétaire à avoir été découvert par observation visuelle directe.

La sixième lune jovienne, Himalia, a été révélée le 3 décembre 1904 en utilisant l'astrophotographie, comme toutes ses nombreuses lunes découvertes par la suite.`,

        author: 'إيان تود، براين جونز',

        body: `أقمار جاليليو للمشتري هي أكبر أربعة أقمار تابعة له: آيو، كاليستو، أوروبا، وجانيميد.

تُعرف باسم أقمار جاليليو لأن أول رصد مسجل لها كان من قبل الفلكي الإيطالي غاليليو غاليلي عام 1610.

أقمار جاليليو عوالم مذهلة. جانيميد، على سبيل المثال، هو أكبر قمر في النظام الشمسي.

آيو هو العالم الأكثر نشاطًا بركانيًا في النظام الشمسي، حيث اكتشفت عالمة الكواكب ليندا مورابيتو براكينه خلال بعثة فوياجر.

أوروبا هو قمر جليدي يخفي محيطًا تحت سطحه تحت قشرته المتجمدة، يشبه كثيرًا قمر زحل إنسيلادوس.

نتيجة لذلك، إنه أحد أفضل الأماكن في النظام الشمسي للبحث عن ظروف يمكن أن تدعم الحياة.

كاليستو هو ثالث أكبر قمر في النظام الشمسي، بعد تيتان قمر زحل، وقد يعتبره البعض العضو الخالي من الحياة والصفات بين أقمار جاليليو الأربعة.

ومع ذلك، هناك أدلة على أن كاليستو يستضيف أيضًا محيطًا تحت سطحه. هل يمكن أن يكون مرشحًا آخر لظروف داعمة للحياة خارج الأرض؟

## كيف تشكلت أقمار جاليليو

يعتقد أن أكبر أقمار المشتري آيو، أوروبا، جانيميد وكاليستو تشكلت على الأرجح من المواد المتبقية من تكون المشتري نفسه.

مثل بقية كواكب النظام الشمسي، تشكل المشتري من قرص الغبار والغاز المحيط بالشمس الصغيرة. بمجرد تكثف هذا الغاز والغبار لتشكيل المشتري، تجمعت المواد المتبقية ونمت مع مرور الوقت لتشكل أقمار جاليليو.

هذا يجعل أكبر أقمار المشتري قديمة على الأرجح مثل بقية النظام الشمسي: حوالي 4.5 مليار سنة.

## رصد أقمار جاليليو للمشتري

أقمار جاليليو هي أيضًا هدف مفضل لعلماء الفلك لأنه من الممكن رؤيتها حول المشتري، بشرط أن يكون لديك تلسكوب كبير بما يكفي.

إذا كنت تعرف متى وأين تنظر، قد تتمكن من رؤية عبور الأقمار أمام المشتري، أو رصد ظلالها على سطح العملاق الغازي، أو حتى احتجاب.

## آيو

**القطر:** 3,660 كم
**الكتلة:** 0.015 من كتلة الأرض
**المسافة المدارية:** 421,800 كم
**محيط الاستواء:** 11,445.5 كم

آيو هو الجسم الأكثر نشاطًا بركانيًا في النظام الشمسي، يستضيف مئات البراكين التي تُبقيها نشطة التفاعلات الجاذبية بين القمر والمشتري والأقمار الأخرى المشترية أوروبا وجانيميد.

لديه مدار شديد التفلطح، وتولد قوى المد والجزر الناتجة عن تفاعله مع المشتري كمية هائلة من الحرارة تتسبب في قذف الحمم المنصهرة من البراكين، ملئة فوهات الاصطدام السطحية.

يجرد المجال المغناطيسي للمشتري المواد من سطح آيو، منتجًا سحابة إشعاعية حول القمر البركاني.

نتيجة لكل هذه العمليات، آيو عالم ديناميكي للغاية، وربما أحد أغرب الأقمار مظهرًا في النظام الشمسي.

وفقًا لليندا مورابيتو، عندما حصل علماء فوياجر على لمحة أولى عن آيو، وصفوه بأنه يشبه "بيتزا متعفنة".

## أوروبا

**القطر:** 3,122 كم
**الكتلة:** 0.008 من كتلة الأرض
**المسافة المدارية:** 670,900 كم
**محيط الاستواء:** 9,807 كم

أصغر الأقمار، أوروبا هو عالم جليدي معروف بوجود محيط سائل تحت قشرته الجليدية التي يتراوح سمكها بين 15-25 كم، والتي قد تحتوي ضعف كمية المياه في جميع محيطات الأرض مجتمعة.

هذا يجعله مكانًا واعدًا للبحث عن الحياة، وهذا بالضبط ما ستفعله بعثات جوس (مستكشف الأقمار الجليدية للمشتري) وإيوروبا كليبر.

تكشف صور أوروبا عن كسور طويلة خطية ومواد بنية محمرة صدئة يمكن أن تكون مركبات مالحة وكبريتية اختلطت بجليد الماء وتعرضت للإشعاع.

سطحه حديث، محتمل أن يكون بعمر 40 مليون سنة فقط، كما يتضح من العدد القليل جدًا من الفوهات المرئية.

كشفت دراسات باستخدام تلسكوب هابل الفضائي أن أوروبا قد يكون في الواقع ينفث ماء من محيطه تحت السطحي إلى الفضاء، مما سيكون أهدافًا رئيسية للبعثات المستقبلية لاستكشاف أوروبا، تمامًا مثل مركبة كاسيني عند قمر زحل إنسيلادوس.

## جانيميد

**القطر:** 5,268 كم
**الكتلة:** 0.025 من كتلة الأرض
**المسافة المدارية:** 1,070,400 كم
**محيط الاستواء:** 16,532 كم

جانيميد عينة فريدة. إنه أكبر قمر في النظام الشمسي والقمر الوحيد الذي يدور حول الشمس بمجال مغناطيسي خاص به. نتيجة لذلك لديه أشفاق قطبية في قطبية الشمال والجنوب.

يعتقد أن لديه نواة صخرية كبيرة مغطاة بطبقات من الجليد والماء، تظهر علامات النشاط التكتوني.

يبدو أن سطح جانيميد له نوعان من التضاريس: مناطق معتمة مليئة بالفوهات وتضاريس أفتح لونًا بها شقوق وأخاديد.

يمكن أن تمتد هذه الأخاديد إلى ارتفاع 700 متر ويمكن أن تكون نتيجة صدوع الشد، أو قد يكون لدى جانيميد محيط تحت سطحه يطلق الماء إلى الفضاء.

## كاليستو

**القطر:** 4,821 كم
**الكتلة:** 0.018 من كتلة الأرض
**المسافة المدارية:** 1,882,700 كم
**محيط الاستواء:** 15,144 كم

كاليستو هو ثاني أكبر قمر للمشتري وربما الحصان الأسود للأقمار الجاليليية. يبدو عالمًا غير نشط جيولوجيًا، معتم، مليء بالفوهات، لكن يعتقد علماء الكواكب أنه يمكن أن يستضيف محيطًا سائلاً تحت سطحه.

هذا لا يقلل مما يحدث على السطح مع ذلك. سطح كاليستو عمره حوالي 4 مليارات سنة - نتيجة لخموله الجيولوجي - ويعتقد أنه أقدم سطح وأكثرها فوهات في النظام الشمسي.

البقع المضيئة التي تنثر سطح كاليستو قد تكون جليد ماء، متجمد على قمم فوهاته الكثيرة.

يمكن أن يتفاعل المحيط تحت السطحي لكاليستو مع طبقة من الصخور بعمق 250 كم، وتم اكتشاف الأكسجين في الغلاف الخارجي للقمر.

هل يمكن أن يكون كاليستو لاعبًا رئيسيًا في البحث عن الحياة في النظام الشمسي؟

## اكتشاف أقمار جاليليو

على صفحة العنوان من كتاب غاليليو "سيدريوس نونسيوس" (الرسول النجمي) - أول عمل فلكي يعتمد على ملاحظات تلسكوبية عندما نُشر عام 1610 - يقول المؤلف إن الكتاب يقدم للقارئ "مشاهد عظيمة ومدهشة للغاية... رصدها غاليليو غاليلي، النبيل الفلورنسي والرياضياتي العام في جامعة بادوا... في أربعة كواكب تدور بسرعة ملحوظة على مسافات وفترات مختلفة حول نجم المشتري.

لم يعرفها أحد حتى هذا اليوم، والمؤلف هو أول من اكتشفها. قرر تسميتها الكواكب الميديشية."

كان التسمية الأولية للأقمار باسم الكواكب الميديشية للاعتراف بالرعاية التي تلقاها من الدوق الأكبر كوزيمو الثاني دي ميديتشي من توسكانا (1590–1621)، الذي خدمه غاليليو كمدرس رياضيات في 1605.

كانت الفكرة الأولى لغاليليو تسمية الأقمار المكتشفة حديثًا "كوزميكا سيديرا" (النجوم الكونية) تكريمًا لراعيه فقط، لكنه اختار في النهاية اسمًا يكرم جميع الإخوة ميديتشي الأربعة الناجين: كوزيمو، فرانشيسكو، كارلو ولورينزو.

أدرك غاليليو أيضًا أن الأجسام الأربعة التي رآها عبر تلسكوبه كانت أول ما يُرى يدور حول كوكب آخر، ولم يفوته أهمية اكتشافه.

لكن على الرغم من أنه قد يكون أول من أطلق عليها أسماء، فإن ادعاء غاليليو بأنه أول من رآها قد شكك فيه البعض.

لقد اقترح أن الفلكي الصيني جان دي، الذي أجرى بعض أقدم الملاحظات المنظمة المعروفة للكواكب في القرن الرابع قبل الميلاد، ربما رأى جانيميد.

كان ذلك أثناء دراسته للمشتري خلال صيف 365 قبل الميلاد سجل جان دي ما وصفه بـ"نجم أحمر صغير" بجانب الكوكب.

اقترح مؤرخ الفلك الصيني شي زيزونغ (1927-2008) أن هذا قد يكون رصدًا مبكرًا لجانيميد.

من الممكن نظريًا رؤية أقمار جاليليو بالعين المجردة، لكن ذلك يتطلب ظروفًا شبه مثالية وبصرًا مذهلاً.

في 1614، بعد حوالي أربع سنوات من نشر سيدريوس نونسيوس، نشر الفلكي الألماني سيمون ماريوس (1753-1625) عمله "موندوس يوفيلس" (1614) الذي وصف فيه كوكب المشتري وأقماره.

ادعى أنه اكتشفهم في ديسمبر 1609.

هذا يعني أن ماريوس رصد الأقمار المشترية قبل غاليليو ببعض الوقت، الذي وفقًا لسيدريوس نونسيوس، رآهم لأول مرة في 7 جانفي 1610.

لكن ما هو مؤكد أن غاليليو كان أول من نشر ما رآه.

كان في ذلك التاريخ وجه غاليليو تلسكوبه نحو المشتري ولاحظ ما وصفه بـ"ثلاث نجوم صغيرة... موضوعة قرب (المشتري) - صغيرة لكنها مشرقة جدًا" ولاحظ وجود "نجم صغير" رابع بعد بضعة أيام.

على الرغم من أن أفكاره الأولى كانت أن هذه "نجوم ثابتة"، إلا أن غاليليو كان مفتونًا بما يكفي بحقيقة أنها "مرتبة بالضبط على طول خط مستقيم وموازية لمسار الشمس" لمواصلة ملاحظاته، التي كشفت في النهاية عن طبيعتها الحقيقية.

بعد الإعلان عن الأقمار في سيدريوس نونسيوس، جاءت التحقق المستقل والرصد للأقمار المشترية المكتشفة حديثًا من عدة مصادر.

تضمنت ذلك مراقبين بارزين مثل يوهانس كيبلر في براغ، الفلكي الإنجليزي توماس هاريوت والفلكي الفرنسي جوزيف جولتييه دي لا فاليت.

بغض النظر عمن رآهم أولاً، الأسماء الأسطورية التي تعرف بها هذه الأقمار اليوم هي تلك التي أعطاها إياها ماريوس (مستوحاة من اقتراح يوهانس كيبلر).

في 1614، كتب في موندوس يوفيلس: "آيو، أوروبا، الصبي جانيميد وكاليستو أسعدوا جوبيتر الشهواني جدًا."

لكن الأسماء لم تكتسب رواجًا حتى أوائل القرن العشرين، principalmente لأن غاليليو رفض استخدامها.

في الوقت نفسه، كانت أقمار جاليليو للمشتري تُشار إليها عمومًا بالمشتري I، II، III و IV وفقًا لقربها من المشتري.

ستستغرق بضعة قرون أخرى حتى يُكتشف القمر التالي للمشتري، أمالثيا، من قبل الفلكي الأمريكي إدوارد إيمرسون بارنارد باستخدام تلسكوب ليك العاكس الكبير 36 بوصة في مرصد ليك في 9 سبتمبر 1892.

يحمل أمالثيا تميزًا بكونه آخر قمر كوكبي يُكتشف بالرصد البصري المباشر.

الكوكب المشتري السادس، هيماليا، كُشف في 3 ديسمبر 1904 باستخدام التصوير الفلكي، كما فعلت جميع أقماره العديدة التي اكتشفت لاحقًا.`,

        body: `Rare Image Of Tatooine-like Planet Is Closest To Its Twin Stars Yet

In a discovery that's fit for a movie, Northwestern University astronomers have directly imaged a Tatooine-like exoplanet, orbiting two suns.

While obtaining an image of a planet beyond our solar system is already rare, finding one that circles two suns is even rarer. But this new world is extra exceptional. It hugs its twin stars more tightly than any other directly imaged planet in a binary system. In fact, it is six times closer to its suns than other previously discovered exoplanets.

The discovery provides an unprecedented look at how planets move and form around multiple stars. It also offers a rare glimpse into how stars and planets orbit together, enabling astrophysicists to test theories of planet formation in complex systems.

The study will be published on Thursday (Dec. 11) in The Astrophysical Journal Letters. Also published in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics, European astronomers at the University of Exeter report the same discovery.

"Of the 6,000 exoplanets that we know of, only a very small fraction of them orbit binaries," said Northwestern's Jason Wang, a senior author of the study. "Of those, we only have a direct image of a handful of them, meaning we can have an image of the binary and the planet itself. Imaging both the planet and the binary is interesting because it's the only type of planetary system where we can trace both the orbit of the binary star and the planet in the sky at the same time. We're excited to keep watching it in the future as they move, so we can see how the three bodies move across the sky."

An expert in exoplanet imaging, Wang is an assistant professor of physics and astronomy at Northwestern's Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences. He also is a member of the Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration and Research in Astrophysics (CIERA). Nathalie Jones, the CIERA Board of Visitors Graduate Fellow at Weinberg and member of Wang's research group, is the study's lead author.

A discovery years in the making

The Northwestern team found the new exoplanet hidden within years-old data. When Wang was a Ph.D. student, he helped commission the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI), a specialized instrument designed to capture images of distant worlds by blocking out the overwhelming glare of their stars. Originally operated at the Gemini South telescope in Chile, GPI used adaptive optics and a coronagraph to sharpen images of faint planets orbiting bright stars.

"We undertook this big survey, and I traveled to Chile several times," Wang said. "I spent most of my time during my Ph.D. just looking for planets. During the instrument's lifetime, we observed more than 500 stars and found only one new planet. It would have been nice to have seen more, but it did tell us something about just how rare exoplanets are."

Nearly a decade later, Wang asked Jones to revisit the data. Scientists and engineers currently are upgrading GPI. Next year, it will move to Hawaii, where it will be installed on the Gemini North telescope atop Mauna Kea. As GPI completed its first chapter in Chile, Wang decided it was time to wrap up his original search.

"I didn't think we'd find any new planets," Wang said. "But I thought we should do our due diligence and check carefully anyway."

Tracking a suspicious object

Jones analyzed GPI data taken between 2016 and 2019 and cross-referenced it with data from the W.M. Keck Observatory, using Northwestern's institutional access. Then, this past summer, she noticed something suspicious. A faint object appeared to be consistently following the motion of a star as it moved across the sky.

"Stars don't stand still in a galaxy, they move around," Wang said. "We look for objects and then revisit them later to see if they have moved elsewhere. If a planet is bound to a star, then it will move with the star. Sometimes, when we revisit a 'planet,' we find it's not moving with its star. Then, we know it was just a photobombing star passing through. If they are both moving together, then that's a sign that it's an orbiting planet."

"We also look at the light coming off an object," Jones added. "We know what light from a star looks like versus what light from a planet looks like. We compared them and decided it better matched what we expect to see from a planet."

To the team's surprise, Jones verified the suspicious object was a planet, which GPI captured in 2016, but it had gone unnoticed in earlier analysis. Also this summer, a European team led by University of Exeter astronomers independently found the same planet in its own reanalysis of the data, confirming Jones' discovery.

Born after dinosaurs walked the Earth

The confirmed planet is huge — six times the size of Jupiter. While hotter than any planet in our solar system, it's relatively cool compared to other directly imaged exoplanets. It's located about 446 light-years away from Earth, which Wang describes as "not within our local solar neighborhood but like the next town over."

Having formed just about 13 million years ago, the new exoplanet also is quite youthful.

"That sounds like a long time ago, but it's 50 million years after dinosaurs went extinct," Wang said. "That's relatively young in universe speak, so it still retains some of the heat from when it formed."

The team also was struck by how close the exoplanet orbited around its host stars. The stars themselves tightly revolve around one another — taking just 18 Earth days to complete one revolution. The planet, however, takes 300 years to orbit the pair. That's a little longer than Pluto takes to orbit our sun.

"You have this really tight binary, where stars are dancing around each other really fast," Wang said. "Then there is this really slow planet, orbiting around them from far away."

What's next

Relatively speaking, though, the planet is much closer to its stars than other directly imaged exoplanets bound to binary systems. Although the Northwestern team does not know how this system formed, they posit the binary stars formed first. Then the planet formed around them.

"Exactly how it works is still uncertain," Wang said. "Because we have only detected a few dozen planets like this, we don't have enough data yet to put the picture together."

The team plans to continue studying the system, so they can learn more about how it formed and how it works. Jones currently is writing proposals to obtain more data.

"I'm asking for more telescope time, so we can continue looking at this planet," Jones said. "We want to track the planet and monitor its orbit, as well as the orbit of the binary stars, so we can learn more about the interactions between binary stars and planets."

Showing that surprises can hide in plain sight, the discovery underscores the continuing scientific value of archival telescope data. Jones also continues to reanalyze the years-old data to see if previous astronomers missed anything else.

"There are a couple suspicious objects," she said, "but what they are, exactly, remains to be seen."

The study, "HD 143811 AB b: A directly imaged planet orbiting a spectroscopic binary in Sco-Cen," was supported by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, U.S. Department of Energy, the National Science Foundation and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation. The Gemini North and Gemini South telescopes make up the International Gemini Observatory, which is funded in part by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) and operated by NSF NOIRLab.`,

Dans une découverte digne d'un film, des astronomes de la Northwestern University ont imagé directement une exoplanète de type Tatooine, orbitant autour de deux soleils.

Bien que l'obtention d'une image d'une planète au-delà de notre système solaire soit déjà rare, en trouver une qui tourne autour de deux soleils l'est encore plus. Mais ce nouveau monde est exceptionnel. Il serre ses deux étoiles plus étroitement que toute autre planète directement imagée dans un système binaire. En fait, il est six fois plus proche de ses soleils que les autres exoplanètes découvertes précédemment.

Cette découverte offre un regard sans précédent sur la façon dont les planètes se déplacent et se forment autour d'étoiles multiples. Elle offre également un aperçu rare de la façon dont les étoiles et les planètes orbitent ensemble, permettant aux astrophysiciens de tester des théories de formation planétaire dans des systèmes complexes.

L'étude sera publiée jeudi (11 décembre) dans The Astrophysical Journal Letters. Publiée également dans la revue Astronomy and Astrophysics, des astronomes européens de l'Université d'Exeter rapportent la même découverte.

"Sur les 6 000 exoplanètes que nous connaissons, seule une très petite fraction d'entre elles orbitent autour de binaires", a déclaré Jason Wang de Northwestern, auteur principal de l'étude. "Parmi celles-ci, nous n'avons une image directe que de quelques-unes, ce qui signifie que nous pouvons avoir une image du binaire et de la planète elle-même. Imager à la fois la planète et le binaire est intéressant car c'est le seul type de système planétaire où nous pouvons tracer à la fois l'orbite de l'étoile binaire et celle de la planète dans le ciel en même temps. Nous sommes impatients de continuer à l'observer à l'avenir pendant qu'ils se déplacent, afin de voir comment les trois corps se déplacent dans le ciel."

Une découverte des années en préparation

L'équipe de Northwestern a trouvé la nouvelle exoplanète cachée dans des données vieilles de plusieurs années. Lorsque Wang était étudiant en doctorat, il a contribué à la mise en service du Gemini Planet Imager (GPI), un instrument spécialisé conçu pour capturer des images de mondes lointains en bloquant l'éblouissement écrasant de leurs étoiles. Initialement exploité au télescope Gemini Sud au Chili, le GPI utilisait l'optique adaptative et un coronographe pour affiner les images de planètes faibles orbitant autour d'étoiles brillantes.

"Nous avons entrepris cette grande enquête, et je me suis rendu au Chili plusieurs fois", a déclaré Wang. "J'ai passé la plupart de mon temps pendant mon doctorat à simplement chercher des planètes. Pendant la durée de vie de l'instrument, nous avons observé plus de 500 étoiles et trouvé une seule nouvelle planète. Cela aurait été bien d'en voir plus, mais cela nous a appris quelque chose sur la rareté des exoplanètes."

Près d'une décennie plus tard, Wang a demandé à Jones de revoir les données. Les scientifiques et ingénieurs mettent actuellement à jour le GPI. L'année prochaine, il déménagera à Hawaï, où il sera installé sur le télescope Gemini North au sommet du Mauna Kea. Alors que le GPI terminait son premier chapitre au Chili, Wang a décidé qu'il était temps de conclure sa recherche originale.

"Je ne pensais pas que nous trouverions de nouvelles planètes", a déclaré Wang. "Mais je pensais que nous devions faire notre diligence raisonnable et vérifier attentivement quand même."

Suivi d'un objet suspect

Jones a analysé les données du GPI prises entre 2016 et 2019 et les a recoupées avec les données de l'observatoire W.M. Keck, en utilisant l'accès institutionnel de Northwestern. Puis, cet été dernier, elle a remarqué quelque chose de suspect. Un objet faible semblait suivre constamment le mouvement d'une étoile alors qu'elle se déplaçait dans le ciel.

"Les étoiles ne restent pas immobiles dans une galaxie, elles se déplacent", a déclaré Wang. "Nous recherchons des objets, puis nous les revisitons plus tard pour voir s'ils se sont déplacés ailleurs. Si une planète est liée à une étoile, elle se déplacera avec l'étoile. Parfois, lorsque nous revisitions une 'planète', nous constatons qu'elle ne se déplace pas avec son étoile. Ensuite, nous savons que ce n'était qu'une étoile passant par là en faisant du photobombing. Si elles se déplacent toutes les deux ensemble, c'est le signe qu'il s'agit d'une planète en orbite."

"Nous examinons également la lumière émise par un objet", a ajouté Jones. "Nous savons à quoi ressemble la lumière d'une étoile par rapport à la lumière d'une planète. Nous les avons comparées et avons décidé qu'elle correspondait mieux à ce à quoi nous nous attendons pour une planète."

À la surprise de l'équipe, Jones a vérifié que l'objet suspect était une planète, que le GPI avait capturée en 2016, mais qui était passée inaperçue dans l'analyse précédente. Également cet été, une équipe européenne dirigée par des astronomes de l'Université d'Exeter a indépendamment trouvé la même planète dans sa propre réanalyse des données, confirmant la découverte de Jones.

Née après que les dinosaures aient marché sur Terre

La planète confirmée est énorme - six fois la taille de Jupiter. Bien que plus chaude que n'importe quelle planète de notre système solaire, elle est relativement fraîche par rapport aux autres exoplanètes directement imagées. Elle est située à environ 446 années-lumière de la Terre, ce que Wang décrit comme "pas dans notre voisinage solaire local mais comme la ville d'à côté."

Ayant été formée il y a seulement environ 13 millions d'années, la nouvelle exoplanète est également assez jeune.

"Cela semble être il y a longtemps, mais c'est 50 millions d'années après l'extinction des dinosaures", a déclaré Wang. "C'est relativement jeune dans le langage de l'univers, donc elle conserve encore une partie de la chaleur de sa formation."

L'équipe a également été frappée par la proximité de l'exoplanète avec ses étoiles hôtes. Les étoiles elles-mêmes tournent étroitement l'une autour de l'autre - mettant seulement 18 jours terrestres pour effectuer une révolution. La planète, quant à elle, met 300 ans pour orbiter autour du couple. C'est un peu plus long que Pluton ne met pour orbiter autour de notre soleil.

"Vous avez ce binaire vraiment serré, où les étoiles dansent l'une autour de l'autre très rapidement", a déclaré Wang. "Ensuite, il y a cette planète vraiment lente, orbitant autour d'elles de loin."

Et ensuite?

Relativement parlant, la planète est beaucoup plus proche de ses étoiles que les autres exoplanètes directement imagées liées à des systèmes binaires. Bien que l'équipe de Northwestern ne sache pas comment ce système s'est formé, elle suppose que les étoiles binaires se sont formées en premier. Ensuite, la planète s'est formée autour d'elles.

"Exactement comment cela fonctionne est encore incertain", a déclaré Wang. "Parce que nous n'avons détecté que quelques dizaines de planètes comme celle-ci, nous n'avons pas encore assez de données pour mettre l'image ensemble."

L'équipe prévoit de continuer à étudier le système, afin d'en apprendre davantage sur sa formation et son fonctionnement. Jones rédige actuellement des propositions pour obtenir plus de données.

"Je demande plus de temps de télescope, afin que nous puissions continuer à observer cette planète", a déclaré Jones. "Nous voulons suivre la planète et surveiller son orbite, ainsi que l'orbite des étoiles binaires, afin d'en apprendre davantage sur les interactions entre les étoiles binaires et les planètes."

Montrant que les surprises peuvent se cacher à la vue de tous, la découverte souligne la valeur scientifique continue des données d'archives des télescopes. Jones continue également de réanalyser les données vieilles de plusieurs années pour voir si les astronomes précédents ont manqué autre chose.

"Il y a quelques objets suspects", a-t-elle dit, "mais ce qu'ils sont exactement reste à voir."

        body: `صورة نادرة لكوكب يشبه تاتوين وهو الأقرب إلى نجميه التوأم حتى الآن

في اكتشاف يليق بفيلم سينمائي، التقط علماء الفلك في جامعة نورث وسترن صورة مباشرة لكوكب خارجي يشبه تاتوين، يدور حول شمسين.

بينما يعتبر الحصول على صورة لكوكب خارج نظامنا الشمسي أمرًا نادرًا بالفعل، فإن العثور على كوكب يدور حول شمسين هو أمر أكثر ندرة. لكن هذا العالم الجديد استثنائي بشكل إضافي. فهو يحتضن نجميه التوأمين بشكل أقرب من أي كوكب تم تصويره مباشرة في نظام ثنائي. في الواقع، إنه أقرب بست مرات إلى شمسيه من الكواكب الخارجية الأخرى المكتشفة سابقًا.

يوفر هذا الاكتشاف نظرة غير مسبوقة لكيفية تحرك الكواكب وتشكلها حول النجوم المتعددة. كما يقدم لمحة نادرة عن كيفية دوران النجوم والكواكب معًا، مما يمكّن علماء الفيزياء الفلكية من اختبار نظريات تكوين الكواكب في الأنظمة المعقدة.

ستُنشر الدراسة يوم الخميس (11 ديسمبر) في The Astrophysical Journal Letters. ونُشر أيضًا في مجلة Astronomy and Astrophysics، حيث أبلغ علماء الفلك الأوروبيون في جامعة إكستر عن نفس الاكتشاف.

قال جيسون وانغ من نورث وسترن، المؤلف الرئيسي للدراسة: "من بين 6000 كوكب خارجي نعرفها، فإن جزءًا صغيرًا جدًا منها فقط يدور حول أنظمة ثنائية. ومن بين تلك، لدينا صورة مباشرة لحفنة منها فقط، مما يعني أنه يمكننا الحصول على صورة للثنائي والكوكب نفسه. إن تصوير كل من الكوكب والثنائي مثير للاهتمام لأنه النوع الوحيد من النظام الكوكبي حيث يمكننا تتبع مدار النجم الثنائي والكوكب في السماء في نفس الوقت. نحن متحمسون لمواصلة مراقبته في المستقبل أثناء تحركه، حتى نتمكن من رؤية كيف تتحرك الأجسام الثلاثة في السماء".

خبير في تصوير الكواكب الخارجية، وانغ أستاذ مساعد في الفيزياء وعلم الفلك في كلية واينبرغ للفنون والعلوم في نورث وسترن. وهو أيضًا عضو في مركز الاستكشاف والبحث متعدد التخصصات في الفيزياء الفلكية (CIERA). ناتالي جونز، زميلة الدراسات العليا في مجلس زوار CIERA في واينبرغ وعضو في مجموعة بحث وانغ، هي المؤلفة الرئيسية للدراسة.

اكتشاف استغرق سنوات في الإعداد

عثر فريق نورث وسترن على الكوكب الخارجي الجديد مخفيًا داخل بيانات قديمة تعود لسنوات. عندما كان وانغ طالب دكتوراه، ساعد في تشغيل Gemini Planet Imager (GPI)، وهو أداة متخصصة مصممة لالتقاط صور للعوالم البعيدة عن طريق حجب الوهج الساحق لنجومها. تم تشغيل GPI في الأصل في تلسكوب Gemini South في تشيلي، واستخدم البصريات التكيفية وكرونوغراف لتحسين صور الكواكب الخافتة التي تدور حول النجوم الساطعة.

قال وانغ: "شرعنا في هذا المسح الكبير، وسافرت إلى تشيلي عدة مرات. قضيت معظم وقتي خلال الدكتوراه في البحث عن الكواكب فقط. خلال عمر الأداة، لاحظنا أكثر من 500 نجم ووجدنا كوكبًا جديدًا واحدًا فقط. كان من الجميل رؤية المزيد، لكنه أخبرنا شيئًا عن مدى ندرة الكواكب الخارجية".

بعد ما يقرب من عقد من الزمان، طلب وانغ من جونز إعادة النظر في البيانات. يقوم العلماء والمهندسون حاليًا بترقية GPI. في العام المقبل، سينتقل إلى هاواي، حيث سيتم تثبيته على تلسكوب Gemini North أعلى Mauna Kea. بينما أكمل GPI فصله الأول في تشيلي، قرر وانغ أن الوقت قد حان لإنهاء بحثه الأصلي.

قال وانغ: "لم أعتقد أننا سنجد أي كواكب جديدة. لكنني اعتقدت أننا يجب أن نقوم بواجبنا والتحقق بعناية على أي حال".

تتبع جسم مشبوه

حللت جونز بيانات GPI المأخوذة بين عامي 2016 و2019 وقارنتها بالبيانات من مرصد W.M. Keck، باستخدام الوصول المؤسسي لجامعة نورث وسترن. ثم، في الصيف الماضي، لاحظت شيئًا مريبًا. يبدو أن جسمًا خافتًا كان يتبع باستمرار حركة نجم وهو يتحرك عبر السماء.

قال وانغ: "النجوم لا تقف ساكنة في المجرة، فهي تتحرك. نبحث عن الأجسام ثم نعيد زيارتها لاحقًا لمعرفة ما إذا كانت قد انتقلت إلى مكان آخر. إذا كان الكوكب مرتبطًا بنجم، فسوف يتحرك مع النجم. في بعض الأحيان، عندما نعيد زيارة 'كوكب'، نجد أنه لا يتحرك مع نجمه. ثم نعلم أنه كان مجرد نجم عابر يظهر في الصورة. إذا كانا يتحركان معًا، فهذه علامة على أنه كوكب يدور في مدار".

وأضافت جونز: "ننظر أيضًا إلى الضوء المنبعث من جسم. نعرف كيف يبدو ضوء النجم مقابل كيف يبدو ضوء الكوكب. قارناهما وقررنا أنه يتطابق بشكل أفضل مع ما نتوقعه من كوكب".

لدهشة الفريق، تحققت جونز من أن الجسم المشبوه كان كوكبًا، التقطه GPI في عام 2016، لكنه لم يُلاحظ في التحليل السابق. أيضًا في هذا الصيف، وجد فريق أوروبي بقيادة علماء الفلك في جامعة إكستر نفس الكوكب بشكل مستقل في إعادة تحليله الخاص للبيانات، مؤكدًا اكتشاف جونز.

وُلد بعد أن مشى الديناصورات على الأرض

الكوكب المؤكد ضخم - أكبر بست مرات من حجم كوكب المشتري. بينما هو أكثر سخونة من أي كوكب في نظامنا الشمسي، فهو بارد نسبيًا مقارنة بالكواكب الخارجية الأخرى التي تم تصويرها مباشرة. يقع على بعد حوالي 446 سنة ضوئية من الأرض، وهو ما يصفه وانغ بأنه "ليس ضمن جوارنا الشمسي المحلي ولكن مثل البلدة المجاورة".

بعد أن تشكلت قبل حوالي 13 مليون سنة فقط، فإن الكوكب الخارجي الجديد شاب أيضًا.

قال وانغ: "يبدو ذلك وكأنه وقت طويل، لكنه 50 مليون سنة بعد انقراض الديناصورات. هذا شاب نسبيًا في حديث الكون، لذلك لا يزال يحتفظ ببعض الحرارة من وقت تكوينه".

كما أصيب الفريق أيضًا بمدى قرب الكوكب الخارجي من نجميه المضيفين. النجوم نفسها تدور بإحكام حول بعضها البعض - حيث تستغرق 18 يومًا أرضيًا فقط لإكمال دورة واحدة. ومع ذلك، يستغرق الكوكب 300 عام للدوران حول الثنائي. هذا أطول قليلاً من الوقت الذي يستغرقه بلوتو للدوران حول شمسنا.

قال وانغ: "لديك هذا الثنائي الضيق حقًا، حيث ترقص النجوم حول بعضها البعض بسرعة كبيرة. ثم هناك هذا الكوكب البطيء حقًا، الذي يدور حولها من بعيد".

ماذا بعد؟

نسبيًا، الكوكب أقرب بكثير إلى نجميه من الكواكب الخارجية الأخرى التي تم تصويرها مباشرة المرتبطة بالأنظمة الثنائية. على الرغم من أن فريق نورث وسترن لا يعرف كيف تشكل هذا النظام، إلا أنهم يفترضون أن النجمين الثنائيين تشكلا أولاً. ثم تشكل الكوكب حولهما.

قال وانغ: "كيف يعمل هذا بالضبط لا يزال غير مؤكد. لأننا اكتشفنا بضع عشرات من الكواكب مثل هذه فقط، ليس لدينا بيانات كافية حتى الآن لوضع الصورة معًا".

تخطط الفريق لمواصلة دراسة النظام، حتى يتمكنوا من معرفة المزيد عن كيفية تشكله وكيف يعمل. تكتب جونز حاليًا مقترحات للحصول على مزيد من البيانات.

قالت جونز: "أطلب المزيد من وقت التلسكوب، حتى نتمكن من الاستمرار في النظر إلى هذا الكوكب. نريد تتبع الكوكب ومراقبة مداره، وكذلك مدار النجمين الثنائيين، حتى نتمكن من معرفة المزيد عن التفاعلات بين النجوم الثنائية والكواكب".

مع إظهار أن المفاجآت يمكن أن تختبئ في مرأى من الجميع، يؤكد الاكتشاف القيمة العلمية المستمرة لبيانات أرشيف التلسكوبات. تواصل جونز أيضًا إعادة تحليل البيانات القديمة لمعرفة ما إذا فات علماء الفلك السابقين أي شيء آخر.

قالت: "هناك بضعة أجسام مشبوهة، ولكن ما هي بالضبط، لا يزال يتعين رؤيته".

        title: 'A new era in solar system astronomy with JWST',
        author: 'G. L. Villanueva & S. N. Milam',
        introduction: 'The exploration of our solar system is being radically changed since the beginning of operations of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in mid 2022. JWST\'s extraordinary sensitivity and instrumentation allow for sensitive searches for the building blocks of life and to test for habitability, also enabling new discoveries on small bodies to giant planets across our solar system and beyond.',
        excerpt: 'JWST\'s revolutionary infrared capabilities are transforming our understanding of solar system objects, from searching for life\'s building blocks to studying planetary evolution.',
        body: `An important theme in the exploration of our solar system has been the search for life and habitability beyond our planet, and the associated investigation of how internal and external processes impact the formation and evolution of planetary bodies. The search relies on the accurate characterization of several fundamental chemical markers (e.g., water, carbon dioxide, ammonia, organics) that serve as the building blocks of life. Many of these species have strong infrared signatures observable with JWST, while geological and evolutionary processes can leave distinctive observable markers across the surfaces and atmospheres of our solar system.

We then ask, where do water and organics in our planet originate from? If the building blocks of life were delivered to Earth by small bodies, are those molecular components present in other objects, or were they also delivered across the solar system? Deciphering these questions requires a systematic and detailed investigation of objects in our solar system, including the highly evolved terrestrial planets (e.g., Mars), the most primordial objects tracing back to the proto-solar nebula (e.g., comets, trans-Neptunian objects), and the gas (Jupiter and Saturn) and icy (Uranus and Neptune) giants, which are the main repositories of volatile species in our solar system. When searching for actual signatures for life and habitability, the fascinating ocean worlds (e.g., Jupiter's moon Europa and Saturn's moon Enceladus), the organic-rich moon Titan, and Mars, all share potentially habitable conditions.

A powerful way to address these questions is via sensitive remote sensing employing space-based and ground-based observatories. For instance, optical and ultraviolet observations with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) have enabled the remote exploration of these objects with high spatial resolution and sensitivity, while primarily focusing on imaging and atomic signatures. Previous infrared space observatories (e.g., Spitzer, Herschel) pierced into wavelengths inaccessible to ground-based observatories and demonstrated the high value of planetary astronomy at longer wavelengths.

The study of astrobiologically relevant species with ground-based observatories is often quite challenging, namely due to the strong presence of these key species in our atmosphere, and therefore restricting detections remotely. Otherwise, impressive ground-based adaptive optics capabilities with ground-based observatories (e.g., Keck, Very Large Telescope) have allowed to explore faint and distant bodies with unprecedented spatial resolutions in the optical and infrared, while advanced high-resolution spectrometers and powerful interferometric radio observatories (e.g., Atacama Large Millimeter Array) have allowed to sensitively probe for organic and volatile species across the solar system in specific spectral windows.

Yet in the summer of 2022, with the beginning of operations for JWST, solar system astronomy was radically changed. A cryogenic space observatory with state-of-the-art imagining and spectroscopic instrumentation across the near to mid-infrared spectral range permits to explore planetary objects with sensitivities many orders of magnitude better than previous generation facilities. Uniquely at infrared wavelengths, the fine spatial resolution delivered with a large 6.5 meters diffraction limited aperture, enables extraordinary mapping and characterization of planetary surfaces and atmospheres.

This capability allows for careful searches of regions of active volatile release, as well as to obtain detailed maps of the dynamical processes acting on the planets Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Such mapping capabilities are particularly critical when studying many of ocean worlds, comets, Jovian moons, embedded moonlets, binary objects, and tightly packed ring systems. JWST has also demonstrated the ability to track a fast dynamical Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) impact event, with a tracking rate over three times faster than for the prelaunch capabilities offered. This permits for detailed studies of small bodies in the inner solar system, such as near-Earth asteroids or active comets, that are still in the JWST field of regard.

In the first year of operations, JWST has been used to study a wide range of solar system objects, setting the foundations for many future unique investigations. The observations sample the faintest, the smallest, the brightest, the biggest, and the fastest moving (e.g., near-Earth asteroids) bodies in our solar system, and employ a wide variety of instrument modes, covering a wide range of wavelengths at extraordinary sensitivities. Such a large dynamic range of available capabilities is essential for solar system research, and ultimately provide unique information regarding the origin, evolution and state of our planetary system.

The revolutionary aspect of this new observatory is perhaps best revealed by the exceptional spectroscopic capabilities offered by JWST. Occasionally referred to as a molecular machine, JWST is uniquely primed for searching and detecting a plethora of gases, ices, and mineral features, thanks to the broad wavelength coverage (0.6 to 28.3 μm) and range of spectral capabilities from low to high resolution. A particularly notable capability is the combination of high-resolution spectra at each pixel obtained across 2-dimensional images with the IFUs (Integral Field Units).

JWST can sensitively probe several water (H2O) fundamental bands, and also probe the ortho/para ratio in water emission, a metric associated with the nuclear spin states of the hydrogen atoms of water and postulated as a diagnostic tracer of the formation temperature of primordial icy bodies. Many strong water ice features are also present at 1.5, 2, 3, 6, and 13 μm, which dominate the spectra of many icy bodies (e.g., Europa, Enceladus), and help decipher the ice structure (e.g., crystalline, amorphous, irradiated), evolution and storage within a given body.

Geological or biological activity, and evolutionary or formation processes over billions of years leave specific signatures on the materials they interact with, which can be tested by analyzing the chemical and mineralogical composition of planetary bodies. The busy C-H hydrocarbon region at 3.3 μm is sensitively resolved with the NIRSpec high-resolution mode enabling the distinction of many bands of various organic compounds, like methanol (CH3OH), ethane (C2H6), methane (CH4), formaldehyde (H2CO), acetylene (C2H2), and hydrogen cyanide (HCN) – A capability rarely available from space. Volcanic and thermal processes tend to produce a higher abundance of complex hydrocarbons relative to methane than biology, while the abundance ratio of several species can assist in exploring active cryovolcanism and its products.

A key spectral window now accessible with JWST is the region near 4.3 μm, where several gas and ice features of carbon dioxide (CO2) and its isotopologues are resolved. This wavelength region cannot be observed with ground-based facilities, and is only poorly resolved on some solar system objects by in-situ missions (e.g., Galileo, Cassini, Deep Impact).

On Earth, atmospheric CO2 is the main carbon source for biology and a dominant product of it, with the CO2 concentration in the pre-industrial era mostly set by life and geological processes. CO2 is also one of the main forms in which carbon is stored across the solar system (the other being CH4), with the CO2, H2O, CO, CH4 abundance ratios being highly diagnostic to the formation and evolution of primordial bodies because these volatiles have notably different sublimation/condensation temperatures. JWST can not only detect the CO2 gas and ice features, but it can also resolve their band shapes and structure.

The data collected in the last months have already demonstrated how ground-breaking JWST has been for solar system research, and many new investigations are now being planned for future cycles. Importantly, the pioneering science provided by JWST on astrobiology and evolutionary processes will not only be restricted to solar system research, but these findings will have strong implications on comparative planetology and the search for life and habitability beyond our system and in extrasolar planets. As we learn more about the diversity of molecular signatures and their connection to active processes in our solar system, we will be able to better correlate these to the data collected on exoplanets with JWST and future observatories. This together with the development of new powerful missions to probe the outer confines of our solar system and beyond, JWST will play a significant role in guiding the instrumentation and capabilities needed to effectively explore these distant worlds.`,

La sensibilité extraordinaire et l\'instrumentation du JWST permettent des recherches sensibles des éléments constitutifs de la vie et des tests d\'habitabilité, permettant également de nouvelles découvertes sur les petits corps jusqu\'aux planètes géantes dans notre système solaire et au-delà.',
        excerpt: 'Les capacités infrarouges révolutionnaires du JWST transforment notre compréhension des objets du système solaire, de la recherche des éléments constitutifs de la vie à l\'étude de l\'évolution planétaire.',
        body: `Un thème important dans l'exploration de notre système solaire a été la recherche de la vie et de l'habitabilité au-delà de notre planète, et l'investigation associée de la façon dont les processus internes et externes impactent la formation et l'évolution des corps planétaires. La recherche repose sur la caractérisation précise de plusieurs marqueurs chimiques fondamentaux (par exemple, l'eau, le dioxyde de carbone, l'ammoniac, les composés organiques) qui servent de blocs de construction de la vie. Beaucoup de ces espèces ont de fortes signatures infrarouges observables avec le JWST, tandis que les processus géologiques et évolutifs peuvent laisser des marqueurs observables distincts sur les surfaces et les atmosphères de notre système solaire.

Nous nous demandons alors, d'où viennent l'eau et les composés organiques de notre planète ? Si les éléments constitutifs de la vie ont été livrés à la Terre par de petits corps, ces composants moléculaires sont-ils présents dans d'autres objets, ou ont-ils également été livrés à travers le système solaire ? Déchiffrer ces questions nécessite une investigation systématique et détaillée des objets de notre système solaire, y compris les planètes terrestres très évoluées (par exemple, Mars), les objets les plus primordiaux remontant à la nébuleuse proto-solaire (par exemple, les comètes, les objets transneptuniens), et les géantes gazeuses (Jupiter et Saturne) et glacées (Uranus et Neptune), qui sont les principaux réservoirs d'espèces volatiles dans notre système solaire. Lorsqu'on recherche des signatures réelles de vie et d'habitabilité, les fascinants mondes océaniques (par exemple, Europe, la lune de Jupiter, et Encelade, la lune de Saturne), la lune riche en matières organiques Titan, et Mars, partagent tous des conditions potentiellement habitables.

Une manière puissante d'aborder ces questions est via la télédétection sensible utilisant des observatoires spatiaux et terrestres. Par exemple, les observations optiques et ultraviolettes avec le télescope spatial Hubble (HST) ont permis l'exploration à distance de ces objets avec une haute résolution spatiale et sensibilité, tout en se concentrant principalement sur l'imagerie et les signatures atomiques. Les observatoires spatiaux infrarouges précédents (par exemple, Spitzer, Herschel) ont pénétré dans des longueurs d'onde inaccessibles aux observatoires terrestres et ont démontré la grande valeur de l'astronomie planétaire à des longueurs d'onde plus longues.

L'étude des espèces pertinentes pour l'astrobiologie avec des observatoires terrestres est souvent très difficile, notamment en raison de la forte présence de ces espèces clés dans notre atmosphère, et donc en restreignant les détections à distance. Sinon, les impressionnantes capacités d'optique adaptative terrestre avec des observatoires terrestres (par exemple, Keck, Très Grand Télescope) ont permis d'explorer des corps faibles et distants avec des résolutions spatiales sans précédent dans l'optique et l'infrarouge, tandis que des spectromètres à haute résolution avancés et de puissants observatoires radio interférométriques (par exemple, l'Atacama Large Millimeter Array) ont permis de sonder de manière sensible les espèces organiques et volatiles à travers le système solaire dans des fenêtres spectrales spécifiques.

Pourtant, à l'été 2022, avec le début des opérations du JWST, l'astronomie du système solaire a radicalement changé. Un observatoire spatial cryogénique avec une instrumentation d'imagerie et spectroscopique de pointe à travers la gamme spectrale du proche à moyen infrarouge permet d'explorer des objets planétaires avec des sensibilités de plusieurs ordres de grandeur meilleures que les installations de la génération précédente. De manière unique aux longueurs d'onde infrarouges, la fine résolution spatiale délivrée avec une grande ouverture de 6,5 mètres limitée par la diffraction, permet une cartographie et une caractérisation extraordinaires des surfaces et atmosphères planétaires.

Cette capacité permet des recherches minutieuses de régions de libération active de volatils, ainsi que l'obtention de cartes détaillées des processus dynamiques agissant sur les planètes Mars, Jupiter, Saturne, Uranus et Neptune. De telles capacités de cartographie sont particulièrement critiques lors de l'étude de nombreux mondes océaniques, comètes, lunes joviennes, satellites enfouis, objets binaires et systèmes d'anneaux étroitement tassés. Le JWST a également démontré la capacité de suivre un événement d'impact dynamique rapide du Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART), avec un taux de suivi plus de trois fois plus rapide que les capacités offertes avant le lancement. Cela permet des études détaillées de petits corps dans le système solaire interne, tels que les astéroïdes géocroiseurs ou les comètes actives, qui sont encore dans le champ de vision du JWST.

Au cours de la première année d'opérations, le JWST a été utilisé pour étudier une large gamme d'objets du système solaire, jetant les bases de nombreuses futures investigations uniques. Les observations échantillonnent les corps les plus faibles, les plus petits, les plus brillants, les plus grands et les plus rapides (par exemple, les astéroïdes géocroiseurs) de notre système solaire, et emploient une grande variété de modes d'instrument, couvrant une large gamme de longueurs d'onde avec des sensibilités extraordinaires. Une telle grande gamme dynamique de capacités disponibles est essentielle pour la recherche sur le système solaire, et fournit finalement des informations uniques concernant l'origine, l'évolution et l'état de notre système planétaire.

L'aspect révolutionnaire de ce nouvel observatoire est peut-être mieux révélé par les capacités spectroscopiques exceptionnelles offertes par le JWST. Occasionnellement appelée machine moléculaire, le JWST est particulièrement préparé pour rechercher et détecter une pléthore de gaz, de glaces et de caractéristiques minérales, grâce à la large couverture en longueur d'onde (0,6 à 28,3 μm) et à la gamme de capacités spectrales de faible à haute résolution. Une capacité particulièrement notable est la combinaison de spectres à haute résolution à chaque pixel obtenus à travers des images 2D avec les IFUs (Unités de Champ Intégral).

Le JWST peut sonder de manière sensible plusieurs bandes fondamentales de l'eau (H2O), et également sonder le rapport ortho/para dans l'émission d'eau, une métrique associée aux états de spin nucléaire des atomes d'hydrogène de l'eau et postulée comme traceur diagnostique de la température de formation des corps glacés primordiaux. De nombreuses caractéristiques fortes de la glace d'eau sont également présentes à 1,5, 2, 3, 6 et 13 μm, qui dominent les spectres de nombreux corps glacés (par exemple, Europe, Encelade), et aident à déchiffrer la structure de la glace (par exemple, cristalline, amorphe, irradiée), l'évolution et le stockage au sein d'un corps donné.

L'activité géologique ou biologique, et les processus évolutifs ou de formation sur des milliards d'années laissent des signatures spécifiques sur les matériaux avec lesquels ils interagissent, qui peuvent être testées en analysant la composition chimique et minéralogique des corps planétaires. La région chargée d'hydrocarbures C-H à 3,3 μm est résolue de manière sensible avec le mode haute résolution du NIRSpec permettant la distinction de nombreuses bandes de divers composés organiques, comme le méthanol (CH3OH), l'éthane (C2H6), le méthane (CH4), le formaldéhyde (H2CO), l'acétylène (C2H2) et le cyanure d'hydrogène (HCN) - Une capacité rarement disponible depuis l'espace. Les processus volcaniques et thermiques ont tendance à produire une abondance plus élevée d'hydrocarbures complexes par rapport au méthane que la biologie, tandis que le rapport d'abondance de plusieurs espèces peut aider à explorer le cryovolcanisme actif et ses produits.

Une fenêtre spectrale clé maintenant accessible avec le JWST est la région près de 4,3 μm, où plusieurs caractéristiques de gaz et de glace de dioxyde de carbone (CO2) et de ses isotopologues sont résolues. Cette région de longueur d'onde ne peut pas être observée avec des installations terrestres, et n'est que peu résolue sur certains objets du système solaire par des missions in situ (par exemple, Galileo, Cassini, Deep Impact).

Sur Terre, le CO2 atmosphérique est la principale source de carbone pour la biologie et un produit dominant de celle-ci, la concentration de CO2 à l'ère pré-industrielle étant principalement déterminée par la vie et les processus géologiques. Le CO2 est également l'une des principales formes sous lesquelles le carbone est stocké à travers le système solaire (l'autre étant le CH4), les rapports d'abondance CO2, H2O, CO, CH4 étant hautement diagnostiques pour la formation et l'évolution des corps primordiaux parce que ces volatils ont des températures de sublimation/condensation notablement différentes. Le JWST peut non seulement détecter les caractéristiques de gaz et de glace de CO2, mais il peut également résoudre leurs formes et structures de bande.

Les données collectées ces derniers mois ont déjà démontré à quel point le JWST a été révolutionnaire pour la recherche sur le système solaire, et de nouvelles investigations sont maintenant planifiées pour les cycles futurs. Important, la science pionnière fournie par le JWST sur l'astrobiologie et les processus évolutifs ne sera pas seulement limitée à la recherche sur le système solaire, mais ces découvertes auront de fortes implications sur la planétologie comparée et la recherche de la vie et de l'habitabilité au-delà de notre système et dans les exoplanètes. Alors que nous en apprenons davantage sur la diversité des signatures moléculaires et leur connexion aux processus actifs dans notre système solaire, nous serons en mesure de mieux les corréler aux données collectées sur les exoplanètes avec le JWST et les futurs observatoires. Cela, avec le développement de nouvelles missions puissantes pour sonder les confins extérieurs de notre système solaire et au-delà, le JWST jouera un rôle significatif en guidant l'instrumentation et les capacités nécessaires pour explorer efficacement ces mondes lointains.`,

        title: 'عصر جديد في علم فلك النظام الشمسي مع تلسكوب جيمس ويب الفضائي',
        author: 'جي. إل. فيلانويفا وإس. إن. ميلام',
        introduction: 'تغير استكشاف نظامنا الشمسي بشكل جذري منذ بدء عمليات تلسكوب جيمس ويب الفضائي (JWST) في منتصف عام 2022. تتيح حساسية التلسكوب الاستثنائية وأدواته عمليات بحث حساسة عن اللبنات الأساسية للحياة واختبار قابلية السكن، مما يمكن أيضًا من اكتشافات جديدة على الأجرام الصغيرة حتى الكواكب العملاقة عبر نظامنا الشمسي وخارجه.',
        excerpt: 'تغير القدرات الثورية للأشعة تحت الحمراء في تلسكوب جيمس ويب الفضائي فهمنا لأجرام النظام الشمسي، من البحث عن اللبنات الأساسية للحياة إلى دراسة التطور الكوكبي.',
        body: `كان موضوعًا مهمًا في استكشاف نظامنا الشمسي البحث عن الحياة وقابلية السكن خارج كوكبنا، والتحقيق المرتبط بكيفية تأثير العمليات الداخلية والخارجية على تكوين وتطور الأجرام الكوكبية. يعتمد البحث على التوصيف الدقيق للعديد من العلامات الكيميائية الأساسية (مثل الماء، ثاني أكسيد الكربون، الأمونيا، المركبات العضوية) التي تعمل كلبنات بناء للحياة. لدى العديد من هذه الأنواع تواقيع قوية للأشعة تحت الحمراء يمكن رصدها بتلسكوب جيمس ويب، بينما يمكن للعمليات الجيولوجية والتطورية أن تترك علامات رصد مميزة عبر أسطح وغلافات نظامنا الشمسي.

ثم نسأل، من أين تأتي المياه والمركبات العضوية في كوكبنا؟ إذا كانت اللبنات الأساسية للحياة قد وصلت إلى الأرض بواسطة أجرام صغيرة، هل هذه المكونات الجزيئية موجودة في أجرام أخرى، أم أنها أيضًا وصلت عبر النظام الشمسي؟ فك شفرة هذه الأسئلة يتطلب تحقيقًا منهجيًا ومفصلاً لأجرام نظامنا الشمسي، بما في ذلك الكواكب الأرضية المتطورة للغاية (مثل المريخ)، والأجرام الأكثر بدائية التي تعود إلى السديم الشمسي الأولي (مثل المذنبات، الأجرام ما وراء نبتون)، والعمالقة الغازية (المشتري وزحل) والجليدية (أورانوس ونبتون)، وهي المستودعات الرئيسية للأنواع المتطايرة في نظامنا الشمسي. عند البحث عن تواقيع فعلية للحياة وقابلية السكن، فإن العوالم المحيطية الرائعة (مثل قمر المشتري أوروبا وقمر زحل إنسيلادوس)، والقمر الغني بالمركبات العضوية تايتان، والمريخ، جميعها تشترك في ظروف محتملة للسكن.

تعد الاستشعار عن بعد الحساس باستخدام المراصد الفضائية والأرضية طريقة قوية لمعالجة هذه الأسئلة. على سبيل المثال، مكنت الملاحظات البصرية وفوق البنفسجية بتلسكوب هابل الفضائي (HST) الاستكشاف عن بعد لهذه الأجرام بدقة مكانية وحساسية عالية، مع التركيز بشكل أساسي على التصوير والتواقيع الذرية. اخترقت المراصد الفضائية للأشعة تحت الحمراء السابقة (مثل سبيتزر، هيرشل) أطوال موجية غير متاحة للمراصد الأرضية وأظهرت القيمة العالية لعلم الفلك الكوكبي عند أطوال موجية أطول.

غالبًا ما تكون دراسة الأنواع ذات الصلة بعلم الأحياء الفلكي باستخدام المراصد الأرضية صعبة للغاية، وذلك بسبب الوجود القوي لهذه الأنواع الرئيسية في غلافنا الجوي، وبالتالي تقييد الاكتشافات عن بُعد. وإلا فإن قدرات البصريات التكيفية الأرضية المثيرة للإعجاب مع المراصد الأرضية (مثل كيك، التلسكوب الكبير جدًا) قد مكنت من استكشاف أجرام خافتة وبعيدة بدقة مكانية غير مسبوقة في البصري والأشعة تحت الحمراء، بينما مكنت المطيافات عالية الدقة المتقدمة والمراصد الراديوية التداخلية القوية (مثل مصفوفة أتاكاما المليمترية الكبيرة) من التحسس الحساس للأنواع العضوية والمتطايرة عبر النظام الشمسي في نطاقات طيفية محددة.

ومع ذلك، في صيف 2022، مع بدء عمليات تلسكوب جيمس ويب، تغير علم فلك النظام الشمسي بشكل جذري. يسمح مرصد فضائي مبرد بمعدات تصوير وطيفية متطورة عبر النطاق الطيفي للأشعة تحت الحمراء القريبة والمتوسطة باستكشاف الأجرام الكوكبية بحساسيات أفضل بمرات عديدة من مرافق الجيل السابق. بشكل فريد عند أطوال موجات الأشعة تحت الحمراء، تمكن الدقة المكانية الدقيقة التي يتم تقديمها بفتحة محددة الحيود كبيرة بقدر 6.5 أمتار، من رسم خرائط وتوصيف استثنائيين للأسطح والغلافات الكوكبية.

تتيح هذه القدرة عمليات بحث دقيقة لمناطق إطلاق المواد المتطايرة النشطة، وكذلك الحصول على خرائط مفصلة للعمليات الديناميكية المؤثرة على كواكب المريخ، المشتري، زحل، أورانوس ونبتون. تكون قدرات رسم الخرائط هذه بالغة الأهمية بشكل خاص عند دراسة العديد من العوالم المحيطية، المذنبات، الأقمار المشتريانية، الأقمار الصغيرة المضمنة، الأجرام الثنائية، وأنظمة الحلقات المتراصة بإحكام. أظهر تلسكوب جيمس ويب أيضًا القدرة على تتبع حدث تأثير سريع الديناميكية لاختبار إعادة توجيه الكويكب المزدوج (DART)، بمعدل تتبع أسرع بأكثر من ثلاث مرات من القدرات المقدمة قبل الإطلاق. هذا يسمح بدراسات مفصلة لأجرام صغيرة في النظام الشمسي الداخلي، مثل الكويكبات القريبة من الأرض أو المذنبات النشطة، التي لا تزال في مجال رؤية تلسكوب جيمس ويب.

في السنة الأولى من العمليات، تم استخدام تلسكوب جيمس ويب لدراسة مجموعة واسعة من أجرام النظام الشمسي، مما وضع الأساس للعديد من التحقيقات الفريدة المستقبلية. تأخذ العينات الملاحظات الأجرام الأكثر خفوتًا، الأصغر، الأكثر سطوعًا، الأكبر، والأسرع حركة (مثل الكويكبات القريبة من الأرض) في نظامنا الشمسي، وتوظف مجموعة متنوعة من أوضاع الأداة، تغطي نطاقًا واسعًا من الأطوال الموجية بحساسيات استثنائية. مثل هذا النطاق الديناميكي الكبير من القدرات المتاحة ضروري لأبحاث النظام الشمسي، ويوفر في النهاية معلومات فريدة تتعلق بأصل وتطور وحالة نظامنا الكوكبي.

ربما يتم الكشف عن الجانب الثوري لهذا المرصد الجديد بشكل أفضل من خلال القدرات الطيفية الاستثنائية التي يقدمها تلسكوب جيمس ويب. يشار إليه أحيانًا باسم الآلة الجزيئية، فإن تلسكوب جيمس ويب مجهز بشكل فريد للبحث والكشف عن مجموعة وفيرة من الغازات، الجليد، والميزات المعدنية، بفضل التغطية الواسعة للأطوال الموجية (0.6 إلى 28.3 ميكرومتر) ونطاق القدرات الطيفية من المنخفضة إلى العالية الدقة. قدرة ملحوظة بشكل خاص هي الجمع بين الأطياف عالية الدقة عند كل بكسل تم الحصول عليها عبر صور ثنائية الأبعاد مع وحدات المجال التكاملي (IFUs).

يمكن لتلسكوب جيمس ويب التحسس الحساس للعديد من النطاقات الأساسية للماء (H2O)، وكذلك التحقق من نسبة أورثو/بارا في انبعاث الماء، وهي مقياس مرتبط بحالات الدوران النووي لذرات الهيدروجين في الماء ومفترض كأثر تشخيصي لدرجة حرارة تكوين الأجرام الجليدية البدائية. توجد أيضًا العديد من ميزات جليد الماء القوية عند 1.5، 2، 3، 6، و13 ميكرومتر، والتي تهيمن على أطياف العديد من الأجرام الجليدية (مثل أوروبا، إنسيلادوس)، وتساعد في فك شفرة هيكل الجليد (مثل بلوري، لاشكلي، مشع)، التطور والتخزين داخل جسم معين.

تترك النشاطات الجيولوجية أو البيولوجية، والعمليات التطورية أو التكوينية على مدى مليارات السنين تواقيع محددة على المواد التي تتفاعل معها، والتي يمكن اختبارها من خلال التحليل التركيبي الكيميائي والمعدني للأجرام الكوكبية. يتم تحليل منطقة الهيدروكربونات المزدحمة C-H عند 3.3 ميكرومتر بشكل حساس مع وضع الدقة العالية لـ NIRSpec مما يمكّن من التمييز بين العديد من النطاقات لمركبات عضوية متنوعة، مثل الميثانول (CH3OH)، الإيثان (C2H6)، الميثان (CH4)، الفورمالديهايد (H2CO)، الأسيتيلين (C2H2)، وسيانيد الهيدروجين (HCN) – وهي قدرة نادرًا ما تكون متاحة من الفضاء. تميل العمليات البركانية والحرارية إلى إنتاج وفرة أعلى من الهيدروكربونات المعقدة بالنسبة للميثان مقارنة بالبيولوجيا، بينما يمكن أن تساعد نسبة الوفرة لعدة أنواع في استكشاف البراكين الجليدية النشطة ومنتجاتها.

نافذة طيفية رئيسية يمكن الوصول إليها الآن بتلسكوب جيمس ويب هي المنطقة القريبة من 4.3 ميكرومتر، حيث يتم تحليل العديد من ميزات الغاز والجليد لثاني أكسيد الكربون (CO2) ونظائره. لا يمكن رصد منطقة الطول الموجي هذه بمرافق أرضية، ويتم تحليلها بشكل ضعيف فقط على بعض أجرام النظام الشمسي بواسطة البعثات الميدانية (مثل جاليليو، كاسيني، ديب إمباكت).

على الأرض، يعتبر CO2 الجوي المصدر الرئيسي للكربون للبيولوجيا ومنتج رئيسي له، مع تركيز CO2 في عصر ما قبل الصناعة الذي تحدده بشكل أساسي الحياة والعمليات الجيولوجية. يعتبر CO2 أيضًا أحد الأشكال الرئيسية التي يتم فيها تخزين الكربون عبر النظام الشمسي (الآخر هو CH4)، مع أن نسب وفرة CO2، H2O، CO، CH4 تكون شديدة التشخيص لتكوين وتطور الأجرام البدائية لأن هذه المواد المتطايرة لها درجات حرارة تسامي/تكثف مختلفة بشكل ملحوظ. لا يمكن لتلسكوب جيمس ويب اكتشاف ميزات غاز وجليد CO2 فحسب، بل يمكنه أيضًا تحليل أشكال وهياكل نطاقاتها.

لقد أظهرت البيانات التي تم جمعها في الأشهر الأخيرة بالفعل مدى إبداع تلسكوب جيمس ويب لأبحاث النظام الشمسي، ويتم الآن التخطيط للعديد من التحقيقات الجديدة للدورات المستقبلية. المهم، أن العلم الرائد الذي يقدمه تلسكوب جيمس ويب حول علم الأحياء الفلكي والعمليات التطورية لن يقتصر فقط على أبحاث النظام الشمسي، ولكن هذه الاكتشافات ستكون لها تداعيات قوية على علم الكواكب المقارن والبحث عن الحياة وقابلية السكن خارج نظامنا وفي الكواكب الخارجية. بينما نتعلم المزيد عن تنوع التواقيع الجزيئية وارتباطها بالعمليات النشطة في نظامنا الشمسي، سنكون قادرين على ربط هذه بشكل أفضل بالبيانات المجمعة على الكواكب الخارجية بتلسكوب جيمس ويب والمراصد المستقبلية. هذا، مع تطوير بعثات قوية جديدة لاستكشاف النطاقات الخارجية لنظامنا الشمسي وما وراءه، سيلعب تلسكوب جيمس ويب دورًا مهمًا في توجيه المعدات والقدرات اللازمة لاستكشاف هذه العوالم البعيدة بفعالية.`,

        title: 'Could dark matter be the same thing as dark energy?',
        author: 'Ethan Siegel',
        introduction: 'Two parts of our Universe that seem to be unavoidable are dark matter and dark energy. Could they really be two aspects of the same thing?',
        excerpt: 'An exploration of the possibility that dark matter and dark energy are related.',
        body: `When it comes to the Universe, what you can easily see isn't always reflective of all there is. It's one of the important reasons why theories and observations/measurements need to go hand-in-hand: observations tell you what's there to the best of our measurement capabilities, and theory allows us to compare what we'd expect to occur versus what's actually seen. When they match up, that's generally an indication that we have a pretty good understanding of what's actually going on. But when they don't, that's a sign that one of two things is occurring:

either the theoretical rules we're applying aren't quite right for this situation,
or there are additional ingredients out there that our observations haven't directly revealed.

Many of the biggest mismatches in the Universe—between what we observe and what we would have expected based solely on what we see—point to two additional ingredients: dark matter and dark energy. But these two seemingly unrelated phenomena have something deeply disconcerting in common: they've only ever been detected indirectly, from the effects they have on the visible structures in our Universe, but never directly in a laboratory setting. It's enough to make one wonder: are these two dark aspects to our Universe, dark matter and dark energy, related to one another? Could they even be integrated, where they're simply two sides of the same coin? Although cosmologists don't normally integrate them together, it's not an impossibility. Here's what the science does (and doesn't) indicate.

There are all sorts of puzzles out there to ponder in the Universe, but on the largest cosmic scales, every single one is gravitational in nature. The issue is this: we think we know what our theory of gravity is, as Einstein's general relativity just keeps passing test after test after test. No matter what phenomenon we throw at it, what this counterintuitive theory predicts matches up exquisitely with what we observe.

We see mass bending light by the exact amount that Einstein's theory predicts: from starlight bent by the Sun in our Solar System to enormous galaxies, quasars, and clusters of galaxies that gravitationally lens background light.

We see gravitational waves with the precise frequency and amplitude that Einstein's theory predicts for merging black holes and inspiraling neutron stars.

The list of Einstein's successes is long, from gravitational redshifts to the Lense-Thirring effect to the precession of black holes in binary orbits to gravitational time dilation and a whole lot more. Every test we've figured out to throw at general relativity, from experiments here on Earth to observations within our Solar System to the arrival of signals from billions of light-years away, all point toward it being correct under every known circumstance.

When we take our theory of gravity and apply it to the entire Universe, we get a set of equations that reveal a very important relationship. They tell us that if you know what your Universe is made up of, the theory of general relativity can predict for you how your Universe is going to behave and evolve. You can literally make your Universe out of anything you can dream up, including regular ingredients like normal matter, radiation, and neutrinos, which are made from particles found in the Standard Model, plus anything else like black holes, gravitational waves, or even hypothetical entities like dark matter and dark energy.

These different ingredients affect the Universe in different ways, and it's pretty easy to understand why. All you have to do is imagine the Universe as it was long ago, when it was smaller, hotter, denser, and more uniform, and to picture how it will evolve over time. As time progresses, the Universe will expand, but different species of energy will behave differently from one another as this occurs.

Normal matter, for instance, will get more dilute as the Universe expands: the number of matter particles stays the same, but the volume which it occupies increases, so its density goes down. However, it will also gravitate, which means that the regions of space that have slightly greater-than-average densities will preferentially attract more of the surrounding matter to them than others, while the regions with a slightly below-average density will tend to give up their matter to the surrounding regions. Over time, the Universe not only gets more dilute, but starts to grow dense structures first on small scales, then on larger ones as time goes on.

Radiation, on the other hand, not only gets more dilute, but also loses energy as the Universe expands. This is because the number of photons, like the number of protons, neutrons, or electrons, is also fixed, so as the volume increases, the number density goes down. But the energy of each individual photon, as defined by its wavelength, will also decrease as the Universe expands; as the distance between any two points stretches, so does the wavelength of a photon traveling through the Universe, causing it to lose energy.

When we look at the galaxies in the Universe, groups and clusters of galaxies, and even the massive, enormous cosmic web that's formed over billions of years, we can examine:

- their internal properties, like how fast the stars and gas and other components inside of them are moving as a function of distance from the center,
- their clustering properties, like how likely you are to find another galaxy at a certain distance from any given galaxy,
- how massive they are, as inferred from the gravitational effects they cause, such as lensing,
- and where (and how much) the normal matter that makes these objects up is located, including gas, dust, stars, plasma, and more.

When we do, we find that the matter we observe—all of the normal matter, radiation, and every other Standard Model particle that ought to exist in the Universe—simply isn't enough to account for what we observe. On every account, from the rotational speeds of individual galaxies to the motions of individual galaxies within clusters to the large-scale clustering of galaxies in the Universe to the overall mass density of the Universe, there's simply too much mass that needs to be there, by about a factor of 600%, to be explained with normal matter alone.

All of these observed phenomena are very, very real, as we have ubiquitous examples of this occurring in a myriad of objects, and extraordinarily few objects that don't exhibit this mismatch between the normal matter that's present and the effects of gravity. However, we're in a little bit of luck, as there's just one ingredient, if we add it to the Universe, that can bring all of this back in line: dark matter.

If, in addition to normal matter, you add this one additional ingredient that is:
- cold, in the sense that it was moving slow relative to the speed of light back when the Universe was very young,
- collisionless, in the sense that it doesn't collide and exchange momentum with either normal matter, radiation, or other dark matter particles,
- dark, in the sense that it's invisible and transparent to radiation and normal matter,
- and matter, in the sense that it's massive and it gravitates,

all of these phenomena, and many others, suddenly line up with the predictions of Einstein's gravity. There are many arguments from people in the minority "camp" of modifying gravity that explain a few of these phenomena—MOND, for MOdified Newtonian Dynamics, in particular, explains many of the phenomena that occur on small cosmic scales (a few million light-years or less) just as well or even better than dark matter does—but any modification that you make necessitates also including either dark matter or something that looks indistinguishably like dark matter. It makes dark matter an extremely compelling candidate for something novel that exists in our Universe.

There's also another important piece of evidence that we haven't talked about yet, however: the cosmic microwave background. If you start off simulating your Universe right at the earliest moments of the hot Big Bang and add in the ingredients we expect to be there, you'll find that by the time the Universe has expanded and cooled enough so that we can form neutral atoms, there will be a pattern of temperature fluctuations that emerges in a scale-dependent way in the Big Bang's leftover glow: the thermal bath of radiation that is redshifted to microwave wavelengths by the present day.

The radiation itself was first detected in the mid-1960s, but it's a herculean task to measure the imperfections in that almost-uniform background, because the hottest areas of the sky are only about 0.01% warmer than the coldest areas. We didn't truly begin to measure these primordial cosmic imperfections until the 1990s with the COBE satellite, whose results were then built upon by BOOMERanG, WMAP, and Planck (and others). Today, we've measured the temperature of the entire microwave sky in nine different wavelength bands, to ~microkelvin precision, down to angular scales as small as 0.05 degrees. The data that we have can only be described as exquisite.

That pattern of fluctuations that you can see is extremely sensitive to what's in your Universe. The magnitude and locations of the various peaks and troughs tells us what's in the Universe, and also rules out models of the Universe that don't align with the data. For example, if you simulate a Universe with only normal matter and radiation, you'd only get about half of the peaks and valleys that we see, plus the peak would occur on too small of an angular scale, plus the temperature fluctuations would be much larger in magnitude. For this set of observations, dark matter is required.

But also, something else, in addition to dark matter, is required. If you take all of the normal matter, dark matter, radiation, neutrinos, etc., that we know are in the Universe, you'd find that this only makes up about a third of the total amount of energy that must be present to give us this data set that we receive from the Universe. There must be another, additional form of energy that's present, and unlike dark matter or normal matter, it cannot clump or cluster together. Whatever this form of energy is—and it is required to get the cosmic microwave background to match our observations—it has to exist in addition to dark matter.

Dark matter and dark energy behave very differently from one another, but they're both "dark" in the sense that they're invisible to any known direct detection method. We can see their indirect effects—for dark matter, on the structure that forms in the Universe; for dark energy, on how the Universe expands and the radiation within it evolves—but they behave very differently from one another. The biggest differences are:

- dark matter clumps, while dark energy appears to be smoothly distributed throughout all of space,
- as the Universe expands, dark matter gets less dense, but the density of dark energy remains constant,
- and dark matter works to slow the expansion of the Universe, while dark energy actively works to cause distant galaxies to appear to accelerate as they recede from us.

You can always make a "unified model" of dark matter and dark energy, and many physicists have done so, but there's absolutely no compelling motivation to do so. If you think there is, you'll have to provide a compelling answer to the following question:

"Why is it more compelling to introduce one new, unified component that has two free parameters to it—one to explain the 'dark matter' effects and another one to explain the 'dark energy' effects—than it is to introduce two independent components that evolve independently of one another?"

This question seems especially poignant when we look at how dark matter and dark energy evolve in terms of relative importance (in terms of what percent of the energy density they make up) as a function of time. From when the Universe was a few tens of thousands of years old until it was about ~7 billion years old, dark matter made up ~80% of the Universe's energy density. Over the past ~6 billion years, dark energy has come to dominate the Universe's expansion, now making up around ~70% of the total amount of energy in the Universe.

As time continues on, dark energy will get more and more important, while all the other forms of energy, including dark matter, will become negligible. If dark matter and dark energy are somehow related to one another, that relationship is subtle and not obvious to physicists given our current understanding of nature. For dark matter, you have to add an additional ingredient that gravitates into clumps, but doesn't collide or exert a pressure. For dark energy, that ingredient doesn't clump or collide, but does exert a pressure.

Are they related? We cannot say for certain. Until we have some evidence that these two things actually are related somehow, we have to take the conservative approach. Dark matter forms and holds together the largest bound structures, but dark energy pushes those individual structures away from one another. The latter is so successful that in 100 billion years or so, all that will be left of our visible Universe is the Local Group of galaxies. Beyond that, there will only be an empty expanse of nothingness, with no other galaxies visible for trillions upon trillions of light-years.`,

        body: `Lorsqu'il s'agit de l'Univers, ce que vous pouvez facilement voir ne reflète pas toujours tout ce qui existe. C'est l'une des raisons importantes pour lesquelles les théories et les observations/mesures doivent aller de pair : les observations vous disent ce qui est là dans la mesure de nos capacités de mesure, et la théorie nous permet de comparer ce que nous attendrions de se produire par rapport à ce qui est réellement observé. Lorsqu'elles correspondent, c'est généralement une indication que nous avons une assez bonne compréhension de ce qui se passe réellement. Mais quand ce n'est pas le cas, c'est le signe que l'une des deux choses suivantes se produit :

soit les règles théoriques que nous appliquons ne sont pas tout à fait adaptées à cette situation,
soit il y a des ingrédients supplémentaires que nos observations n'ont pas directement révélés.

Beaucoup des plus grandes divergences dans l'Univers - entre ce que nous observons et ce à quoi nous nous serions attendus sur la base de ce que nous voyons - pointent vers deux ingrédients supplémentaires : la matière noire et l'énergie noire. Mais ces deux phénomènes apparemment sans rapport ont quelque chose de profondément déconcertant en commun : ils n'ont jamais été détectés que indirectement, à partir des effets qu'ils ont sur les structures visibles de notre Univers, mais jamais directement en laboratoire. C'est suffisant pour se demander : ces deux aspects sombres de notre Univers, la matière noire et l'énergie noire, sont-ils liés l'un à l'autre ? Pourraient-ils même être intégrés, où ils ne seraient que les deux faces d'une même pièce ? Bien que les cosmologistes ne les intègrent normalement pas ensemble, ce n'est pas une impossibilité. Voici ce que la science indique (et n'indique pas).

Il y a toutes sortes d'énigmes à méditer dans l'Univers, mais sur les plus grandes échelles cosmiques, toutes sont de nature gravitationnelle. Le problème est le suivant : nous pensons connaître notre théorie de la gravité, car la relativité générale d'Einstein ne cesse de passer test après test. Peu importe le phénomène que nous lui soumettons, ce que cette théorie contre-intuitive prédit correspond parfaitement à ce que nous observons.

Nous voyons la masse courber la lumière exactement de la quantité que prédit la théorie d'Einstein : de la lumière des étoiles courbée par le Soleil dans notre Système solaire aux énormes galaxies, quasars et amas de galaxies qui lentillent gravitationnellement la lumière de fond.

Nous voyons des ondes gravitationnelles avec la fréquence et l'amplitude précises que prédit la théorie d'Einstein pour les fusions de trous noirs et les inspirales d'étoiles à neutrons.

La liste des succès d'Einstein est longue, des décalages vers le rouge gravitationnels à l'effet Lense-Thirring en passant par la précession des trous noirs dans les orbites binaires, la dilatation gravitationnelle du temps et bien plus encore. Chaque test que nous avons imaginé pour la relativité générale, des expériences ici sur Terre aux observations dans notre Système solaire en passant par l'arrivée de signaux de milliards d'années-lumière, tous pointent vers le fait qu'elle est correcte dans toutes les circonstances connues.

Lorsque nous prenons notre théorie de la gravité et l'appliquons à l'ensemble de l'Univers, nous obtenons un ensemble d'équations qui révèlent une relation très importante. Elles nous disent que si vous savez de quoi votre Univers est composé, la théorie de la relativité générale peut prédire pour vous comment votre Univers va se comporter et évoluer. Vous pouvez littéralement créer votre Univers à partir de tout ce que vous pouvez imaginer, y compris des ingrédients réguliers comme la matière normale, le rayonnement et les neutrinos, qui sont constitués de particules trouvées dans le Modèle Standard, ainsi que tout autre chose comme les trous noirs, les ondes gravitationnelles, ou même des entités hypothétiques comme la matière noire et l'énergie noire.

Ces différents ingrédients affectent l'Univers de différentes manières, et il est assez facile de comprendre pourquoi. Il suffit d'imaginer l'Univers tel qu'il était il y a longtemps, lorsqu'il était plus petit, plus chaud, plus dense et plus uniforme, et d'imaginer comment il évoluera au fil du temps. Au fur et à mesure que le temps progresse, l'Univers s'étendra, mais différentes espèces d'énergie se comporteront différemment les unes des autres à mesure que cela se produit.

La matière normale, par exemple, se diluera à mesure que l'Univers s'étend : le nombre de particules de matière reste le même, mais le volume qu'elle occupe augmente, donc sa densité diminue. Cependant, elle gravitera également, ce qui signifie que les régions de l'espace qui ont des densités légèrement supérieures à la moyenne attireront préférentiellement plus de matière environnante que les autres, tandis que les régions ayant une densité légèrement inférieure à la moyenne auront tendance à céder leur matière aux régions environnantes. Au fil du temps, l'Univers non seulement se dilue, mais commence à développer des structures denses d'abord à petite échelle, puis à plus grande échelle au fil du temps.

Le rayonnement, quant à lui, non seulement se dilue, mais perd également de l'énergie à mesure que l'Univers s'étend. C'est parce que le nombre de photons, comme le nombre de protons, de neutrons ou d'électrons, est également fixe, donc à mesure que le volume augmente, la densité numérique diminue. Mais l'énergie de chaque photon individuel, telle que définie par sa longueur d'onde, diminuera également à mesure que l'Univers s'étend ; à mesure que la distance entre deux points s'étire, la longueur d'onde d'un photon voyageant à travers l'Univers s'étire également, ce qui lui fait perdre de l'énergie.

Lorsque nous regardons les galaxies de l'Univers, les groupes et amas de galaxies, et même l'immense et énorme toile cosmique qui s'est formée sur des milliards d'années, nous pouvons examiner :

- leurs propriétés internes, comme la vitesse à laquelle les étoiles, le gaz et les autres composants à l'intérieur se déplacent en fonction de la distance par rapport au centre,
- leurs propriétés de regroupement, comme la probabilité de trouver une autre galaxie à une certaine distance de n'importe quelle galaxie donnée,
- leur masse, telle qu'inférée à partir des effets gravitationnels qu'elles provoquent, tels que la lentille gravitationnelle,
- et où (et combien) la matière normale qui compose ces objets est située, y compris le gaz, la poussière, les étoiles, le plasma, et plus encore.

Lorsque nous le faisons, nous constatons que la matière que nous observons - toute la matière normale, le rayonnement et toutes les autres particules du Modèle Standard qui devraient exister dans l'Univers - n'est tout simplement pas suffisante pour expliquer ce que nous observons. Sur tous les plans, des vitesses de rotation des galaxies individuelles aux mouvements des galaxies individuelles dans les amas en passant par le regroupement à grande échelle des galaxies dans l'Univers jusqu'à la densité de masse globale de l'Univers, il y a tout simplement trop de masse qui doit être là, d'environ un facteur de 600%, pour être expliquée par la seule matière normale.

Tous ces phénomènes observés sont très, très réels, car nous avons des exemples omniprésents de cela se produisant dans une myriade d'objets, et extraordinairement peu d'objets qui ne présentent pas cette divergence entre la matière normale présente et les effets de la gravité. Cependant, nous avons un peu de chance, car il y a juste un ingrédient, si nous l'ajoutons à l'Univers, qui peut ramener tout cela en ligne : la matière noire.

Si, en plus de la matière normale, vous ajoutez cet ingrédient supplémentaire qui est :
- froid, dans le sens où il se déplaçait lentement par rapport à la vitesse de la lumière lorsque l'Univers était très jeune,
- sans collision, dans le sens où il n'entre pas en collision et n'échange pas de quantité de mouvement avec la matière normale, le rayonnement ou d'autres particules de matière noire,
- sombre, dans le sens où il est invisible et transparent au rayonnement et à la matière normale,
- et matière, dans le sens où il est massif et gravite,

tous ces phénomènes, et bien d'autres, s'alignent soudainement avec les prédictions de la gravité d'Einstein. Il y a de nombreux arguments de la part des personnes du "camp" minoritaire de la modification de la gravité qui expliquent quelques-uns de ces phénomènes - MOND, pour MOdified Newtonian Dynamics, en particulier, explique beaucoup de phénomènes qui se produisent à petite échelle cosmique (quelques millions d'années-lumière ou moins) aussi bien ou même mieux que la matière noire - mais toute modification que vous apportez nécessite également d'inclure soit de la matière noire, soit quelque chose qui y ressemble de manière indistincte. Cela fait de la matière noire un candidat extrêmement convaincant pour quelque chose de nouveau qui existe dans notre Univers.

Il y a aussi une autre preuve importante dont nous n'avons pas encore parlé, cependant : le fond diffus cosmologique. Si vous commencez à simuler votre Univers dès les premiers instants du Big Bang chaud et ajoutez les ingrédients que nous nous attendons à y trouver, vous constaterez qu'au moment où l'Univers s'est étendu et refroidi suffisamment pour que nous puissions former des atomes neutres, un modèle de fluctuations de température émergera de manière dépendante de l'échelle dans la lueur résiduelle du Big Bang : le bain thermique de rayonnement qui est décalé vers le rouge aux longueurs d'onde micro-ondes à l'époque actuelle.

Le rayonnement lui-même a été détecté pour la première fois au milieu des années 1960, mais c'est une tâche herculéenne que de mesurer les imperfections de ce fond presque uniforme, car les zones les plus chaudes du ciel ne sont qu'environ 0,01% plus chaudes que les zones les plus froides. Nous n'avons vraiment commencé à mesurer ces imperfections cosmiques primordiales que dans les années 1990 avec le satellite COBE, dont les résultats ont ensuite été développés par BOOMERanG, WMAP et Planck (et d'autres). Aujourd'hui, nous avons mesuré la température de tout le ciel micro-ondes dans neuf bandes de longueur d'onde différentes, avec une précision de ~microkelvin, jusqu'à des échelles angulaires aussi petites que 0,05 degré. Les données que nous avons ne peuvent être décrites que comme exquises.

Ce modèle de fluctuations que vous pouvez voir est extrêmement sensible à ce qui se trouve dans votre Univers. L'amplitude et l'emplacement des différents pics et creux nous indiquent ce qui se trouve dans l'Univers, et excluent également les modèles d'Univers qui ne s'alignent pas sur les données. Par exemple, si vous simulez un Univers avec uniquement de la matière normale et du rayonnement, vous n'obtiendriez qu'environ la moitié des pics et des vallées que nous voyons, en plus le pic se produirait sur une échelle angulaire trop petite, et les fluctuations de température seraient beaucoup plus importantes en amplitude. Pour cet ensemble d'observations, la matière noire est requise.

Mais aussi, quelque chose d'autre, en plus de la matière noire, est requis. Si vous prenez toute la matière normale, la matière noire, le rayonnement, les neutrinos, etc., que nous savons être dans l'Univers, vous constaterez que cela ne représente qu'environ un tiers de la quantité totale d'énergie qui doit être présente pour nous donner cet ensemble de données que nous recevons de l'Univers. Il doit y avoir une autre forme d'énergie supplémentaire qui est présente, et contrairement à la matière noire ou à la matière normale, elle ne peut pas s'agglomérer ou se regrouper. Quelle que soit cette forme d'énergie - et elle est nécessaire pour que le fond diffus cosmologique corresponde à nos observations - elle doit exister en plus de la matière noire.

La matière noire et l'énergie noire se comportent très différemment l'une de l'autre, mais elles sont toutes deux "sombres" dans le sens où elles sont invisibles à toute méthode de détection directe connue. Nous pouvons voir leurs effets indirects - pour la matière noire, sur la structure qui se forme dans l'Univers ; pour l'énergie noire, sur la façon dont l'Univers s'étend et le rayonnement à l'intérieur évolue - mais elles se comportent très différemment l'une de l'autre. Les plus grandes différences sont :

- la matière noire s'agglomère, tandis que l'énergie noire semble être uniformément répartie dans tout l'espace,
- à mesure que l'Univers s'étend, la matière noire devient moins dense, mais la densité de l'énergie noire reste constante,
- et la matière noire travaille à ralentir l'expansion de l'Univers, tandis que l'énergie noire travaille activement à faire apparaître les galaxies lointaines comme accélérant à mesure qu'elles s'éloignent de nous.

Vous pouvez toujours faire un "modèle unifié" de la matière noire et de l'énergie noire, et de nombreux physiciens l'ont fait, mais il n'y a absolument aucune motivation convaincante à le faire. Si vous pensez qu'il y en a une, vous devrez fournir une réponse convaincante à la question suivante :

"Pourquoi est-il plus convaincant d'introduire un nouveau composant unifié qui a deux paramètres libres - un pour expliquer les effets de la 'matière noire' et un autre pour expliquer les effets de l''énergie noire' - que d'introduire deux composants indépendants qui évoluent indépendamment l'un de l'autre ?"

Cette question semble particulièrement poignante lorsque nous regardons comment la matière noire et l'énergie noire évoluent en termes d'importance relative (en termes de pourcentage de la densité d'énergie qu'elles représentent) en fonction du temps. Depuis que l'Univers avait quelques dizaines de milliers d'années jusqu'à ce qu'il ait environ ~7 milliards d'années, la matière noire représentait ~80% de la densité d'énergie de l'Univers. Au cours des ~6 derniers milliards d'années, l'énergie noire est venue dominer l'expansion de l'Univers, représentant aujourd'hui environ ~70% de la quantité totale d'énergie dans l'Univers.

Au fil du temps, l'énergie noire deviendra de plus en plus importante, tandis que toutes les autres formes d'énergie, y compris la matière noire, deviendront négligeables. Si la matière noire et l'énergie noire sont en quelque sorte liées l'une à l'autre, cette relation est subtile et n'est pas évidente pour les physiciens étant donné notre compréhension actuelle de la nature. Pour la matière noire, vous devez ajouter un ingrédient supplémentaire qui gravite en amas, mais qui n'entre pas en collision ni n'exerce une pression. Pour l'énergie noire, cet ingrédient ne s'agglomère pas et n'entre pas en collision, mais exerce une pression.

Sont-elles liées ? Nous ne pouvons pas le dire avec certitude. Jusqu'à ce que nous ayons des preuves que ces deux choses sont en quelque sorte liées, nous devons adopter l'approche conservatrice. La matière noire forme et maintient les plus grandes structures liées, mais l'énergie noire pousse ces structures individuelles les unes loin des autres. Cette dernière est si réussie que dans 100 milliards d'années environ, tout ce qui restera de notre Univers visible est le Groupe Local de galaxies. Au-delà, il n'y aura qu'une étendue vide de néant, sans aucune autre galaxie visible pendant des billions et des billions d'années-lumière.`,

        body: `عندما يتعلق الأمر بالكون، فإن ما يمكنك رؤيته بسهولة لا يعكس دائمًا كل ما هو موجود. إنه أحد الأسباب المهمة التي تجعل النظريات والملاحظات / القياسات تحتاج إلى أن تسير جنبًا إلى جنب: تخبرك الملاحظات بما هو موجود إلى أفضل قدراتنا القياسية، وتسمح لنا النظرية بمقارنة ما نتوقع حدوثه مقابل ما يُرى بالفعل. عندما تتطابق، فهذا عمومًا مؤشر على أن لدينا فهمًا جيدًا لما يحدث بالفعل. ولكن عندما لا تتطابق، فهذا علامة على أن أحد أمرين يحدث:

إما أن القواعد النظرية التي نطبقها ليست مناسبة تمامًا لهذا الموقف،
أو أن هناك مكونات إضافية لم تكشف عنها ملاحظاتنا مباشرة.

تشير العديد من أكبر التباينات في الكون - بين ما نلاحظه وما كنا نتوقعه بناءً على ما نراه فقط - إلى مكونين إضافيين: المادة المظلمة والطاقة المظلمة. لكن هاتين الظاهريتين اللتين تبدوان غير مرتبطتين لهما شيء مشترك بشكل عميق ومقلق: لم يتم اكتشافهما أبدًا إلا بشكل غير مباشر، من خلال آثارهما على الهياكل المرئية في كوننا، ولكن لم يتم اكتشافهما مباشرة في بيئة معملية. هذا يكفي للتساؤل: هل هذان الجانبان المظلمان لكوننا، المادة المظلمة والطاقة المظلمة، مرتبطان ببعضهما البعض؟ هل يمكن حتى دمجهما، حيث أنهما مجرد وجهان لعملة واحدة؟ على الرغم من أن علماء الكونيات لا يدمجونهما معًا عادةً، إلا أن هذا ليس مستحيلاً. إليك ما تشير إليه العلوم (وما لا تشير إليه).

هناك كل أنواع الألغاز للتأمل في الكون، ولكن على أكبر المقاييس الكونية، كل واحدة منها هي جاذبية في طبيعتها. المشكلة هي: نعتقد أننا نعرف ما هي نظرية الجاذبية الخاصة بنا، حيث أن النسبية العامة لأينشتاين تستمر في اجتياز الاختبار تلو الاختبار. بغض النظر عن الظاهرة التي نلقيها عليها، فإن ما تتنبأ به هذه النظرية غير البديهية يتطابق بدقة مع ما نلاحظه.

نرى الكتلة تنحني الضوء بنفس الكمية بالضبط التي تتنبأ بها نظرية أينشتاين: من ضوء النجوم المنحني بواسطة الشمس في نظامنا الشمسي إلى المجرات الهائلة، والكوازارات، وعناقيد المجرات التي تعمل كعدسة جاذبية للضوء الخلفي.

نرى موجات الجاذبية بنفس التردد والسعة بالضبط التي تتنبأ بها نظرية أينشتاين لثقوب سوداء تندمج ونجوم نيوترونية في مدارات حلزونية.

قائمة نجاحات أينشتاين طويلة، من الانزياح الأحمر الجاذبي إلى تأثير لينز-ثيرينج إلى تقدم الثقوب السوداء في المدارات الثنائية إلى تمدد الزمن الجاذبي وغير ذلك الكثير. كل اختبار ابتكرناه للنسبية العامة، من التجارب هنا على الأرض إلى الملاحظات داخل نظامنا الشمسي إلى وصول الإشارات من مليارات السنين الضوئية، كلها تشير إلى أنها صحيحة في كل الظروف المعروفة.

عندما نأخذ نظرية الجاذبية الخاصة بنا ونطبقها على الكون بأكمله، نحصل على مجموعة من المعادلات التي تكشف عن علاقة مهمة جدًا. تخبرنا أنه إذا كنت تعرف مما يتكون كونك، يمكن لنظرية النسبية العامة أن تتنبأ لك بكيفية سلوك كونك وتطوره. يمكنك حرفيًا صنع كونك من أي شيء يمكنك تخيله، بما في ذلك المكونات العادية مثل المادة العادية والإشعاع والنيوترينوهات، التي تتكون من جسيمات موجودة في النموذج القياسي، بالإضافة إلى أي شيء آخر مثل الثقوب السوداء، وموجات الجاذبية، أو حتى كيانات افتراضية مثل المادة المظلمة والطاقة المظلمة.

تؤثر هذه المكونات المختلفة على الكون بطرق مختلفة، ومن السهل جدًا فهم السبب. كل ما عليك فعله هو تخيل الكون كما كان منذ زمن طويل، عندما كان أصغر حجمًا وأكثر سخونة وكثافة وتجانسًا، وتصوير كيف سيتطور بمرور الوقت. مع تقدم الوقت، سيتوسع الكون، لكن أنواع الطاقة المختلفة ستتصرف بشكل مختلف عن بعضها البعض مع حدوث ذلك.

المادة العادية، على سبيل المثال، ستصبح أكثر تخفيفًا مع توسع الكون: يبقى عدد جسيمات المادة كما هو، لكن الحجم الذي تشغله يزداد، لذلك تنخفض كثافتها. ومع ذلك، ستجذب أيضًا، مما يعني أن مناطق الفضاء التي لديها كثافات أعلى قليلاً من المتوسط ستجذب المزيد من المادة المحيطة بها أكثر من غيرها، بينما تميل المناطق ذات الكثافة الأقل قليلاً من المتوسط إلى التخلي عن مادتها للمناطق المحيطة. مع مرور الوقت، لا يصبح الكون أكثر تخفيفًا فحسب، بل يبدأ في تكوين هياكل كثيفة أولاً على نطاقات صغيرة، ثم على نطاقات أكبر مع مرور الوقت.

من ناحية أخرى، لا يصبح الإشعاع أكثر تخفيفًا فحسب، بل يفقد أيضًا الطاقة مع توسع الكون. هذا لأن عدد الفوتونات، مثل عدد البروتونات أو النيوترونات أو الإلكترونات، ثابت أيضًا، لذلك مع زيادة الحجم، تنخفض الكثافة العددية. لكن طاقة كل فوتون فردي، كما تحددها طوله الموجي، ستنخفض أيضًا مع توسع الكون؛ مع تمدد المسافة بين أي نقطتين، فإن الطول الموجي للفوتون الذي يسافر عبر الكون يتمدد أيضًا، مما يجعله يفقد الطاقة.

عندما ننظر إلى المجرات في الكون، ومجموعات وعناقيد المجرات، وحتى الشبكة الكونية الهائلة الضخمة التي تشكلت على مدى مليارات السنين، يمكننا فحص:

- خصائصها الداخلية، مثل مدى سرعة حركة النجوم والغاز والمكونات الأخرى بداخلها كدالة للمسافة من المركز،
- خصائص تجمعها، مثل احتمالية وجود مجرة أخرى على مسافة معينة من أي مجرة معينة،
- كتلتها، كما يُستدل عليها من آثار الجاذبية التي تسببها، مثل العدسة الجاذبية،
- وأين (ومدى) وجود المادة العادية التي تتكون منها هذه الأجسام، بما في ذلك الغاز والغبار والنجوم والبلازما والمزيد.

عندما نفعل ذلك، نجد أن المادة التي نلاحظها - كل المادة العادية، والإشعاع، وكل جسيم آخر في النموذج القياسي الذي يجب أن يوجد في الكون - ليست كافية ببساطة لتفسير ما نلاحظه. في كل حساب، من سرعات دوران المجرات الفردية إلى حركات المجرات الفردية داخل العناقيد إلى التجمع واسع النطاق للمجرات في الكون إلى كثافة الكتلة الإجمالية للكون، هناك ببساطة كتلة زائدة يجب أن تكون هناك، بحوالي عامل 600٪، لتفسيرها بالمادة العادية وحدها.

كل هذه الظواهر المرصودة حقيقية جدًا، لأن لدينا أمثلة منتشرة في كل مكان لحدوث هذا في عدد لا يحصى من الأجسام، وعدد قليل جدًا من الأجسام التي لا تظهر هذا التباين بين المادة العادية الموجودة وآثار الجاذبية. ومع ذلك، نحن محظوظون قليلاً، حيث أن هناك مكونًا واحدًا فقط، إذا أضفناه إلى الكون، يمكنه إعادة كل هذا إلى المسار الصحيح: المادة المظلمة.

إذا، بالإضافة إلى المادة العادية، أضفت هذا المكون الإضافي الواحد الذي هو:
- بارد، بمعنى أنه كان يتحرك ببطء بالنسبة لسرعة الضوء عندما كان الكون صغيرًا جدًا،
- لا يصطدم، بمعنى أنه لا يصطدم ولا يتبادل الزخم مع المادة العادية أو الإشعاع أو جسيمات المادة المظلمة الأخرى،
- مظلم، بمعنى أنه غير مرئي وشفاف للإشعاع والمادة العادية،
- ومادة، بمعنى أنه ضخم ويجذب،

فجأة تتوافق كل هذه الظواهر، والعديد غيرها، مع تنبؤات جاذبية أينشتاين. هناك العديد من الحجج من الأشخاص في "معسكر" الأقلية لتعديل الجاذبية التي تفسر بعض هذه الظواهر - MOND، لـ MOdified Newtonian Dynamics، على وجه الخصوص، يشرح العديد من الظواهر التي تحدث على نطاقات كونية صغيرة (بضعة ملايين من السنين الضوئية أو أقل) بنفس جودة أو حتى أفضل مما تفعله المادة المظلمة - لكن أي تعديل تقوم به يتطلب أيضًا تضمين إما مادة مظلمة أو شيء يبدو مشابهًا لها بشكل لا يمكن تمييزه. هذا يجعل المادة المظلمة مرشحًا مقنعًا للغاية لشيء جديد موجود في كوننا.

هناك أيضًا دليل مهم آخر لم نتحدث عنه بعد، ومع ذلك: الخلفية الكونية الميكروية. إذا بدأت في محاكاة كونك في اللحظات الأولى من الانفجار العظيم الحار وأضفت المكونات التي نتوقع وجودها، ستجد أنه بحلول الوقت الذي يتمدد فيه الكون ويبرد بدرجة كافية حتى نتمكن من تكوين ذرات محايدة، سينشأ نمط من التقلبات في درجة الحرارة بطريقة تعتمد على المقياس في التوهج المتبقي من الانفجار العظيم: الحمام الحراري للإشعاع الذي انزياح نحو الأحمر إلى أطوال موجية ميكروية في الوقت الحاضر.

تم اكتشاف الإشعاع نفسه لأول مرة في منتصف الستينيات، لكنها مهمة جبارة لقياس العيوب في تلك الخلفية شبه الموحدة، لأن المناطق الأكثر سخونة في السماء أكثر دفئًا بنحو 0.01٪ فقط من المناطق الأكثر برودة. لم نبدأ حقًا في قياس هذه العيوب الكونية الأولية حتى التسعينيات مع القمر الصناعي COBE، الذي تم البناء على نتائجه بعد ذلك بواسطة BOOMERanG وWMAP وPlanck (وآخرون). اليوم، قمنا بقياس درجة حرارة السماء الميكروية بأكملها في تسع نطاقات طول موجي مختلفة، بدقة تصل إلى ~ميكروكلفن، وصولاً إلى مقاييس زاوية صغيرة تصل إلى 0.05 درجة. لا يمكن وصف البيانات التي لدينا إلا بأنها رائعة.

هذا النمط من التقلبات الذي يمكنك رؤيته حساس للغاية لما يوجد في كونك. يخبرنا حجم ومواقع القمم والأخاديد المختلفة بما يوجد في الكون، كما يستبعد نماذج الكون التي لا تتماشى مع البيانات. على سبيل المثال، إذا قمت بمحاكاة كون به مادة عادية وإشعاع فقط، فستحصل على حوالي نصف القمم والأودية التي نراها، بالإضافة إلى أن القمة ستحدث على مقياس زاوي صغير جدًا، كما أن تقلبات درجة الحرارة ستكون أكبر بكثير في الحجم. بالنسبة لمجموعة الملاحظات هذه، يلزم وجود مادة مظلمة.

لكن أيضًا، شيء آخر، بالإضافة إلى المادة المظلمة، مطلوب. إذا أخذت كل المادة العادية، والمادة المظلمة، والإشعاع، والنيوترينوهات، وما إلى ذلك، التي نعلم أنها موجودة في الكون، ستجد أن هذا يشكل حوالي ثلث إجمالي كمية الطاقة التي يجب أن تكون موجودة لإعطائنا مجموعة البيانات هذه التي نتلقاها من الكون. يجب أن يكون هناك شكل آخر من أشكال الطاقة الإضافية الموجودة، وعلى عكس المادة المظلمة أو المادة العادية، لا يمكن أن تتكتل أو تتجمع. مهما كان شكل الطاقة هذا - وهو مطلوب لجعل الخلفية الكونية الميكروية تتطابق مع ملاحظاتنا - يجب أن يوجد بالإضافة إلى المادة المظلمة.

تتصرف المادة المظلمة والطاقة المظلمة بشكل مختلف تمامًا عن بعضهما البعض، لكن كلاهما "مظلم" بمعنى أنهما غير مرئيين لأي طريقة كشف مباشرة معروفة. يمكننا رؤية آثارهما غير المباشرة - بالنسبة للمادة المظلمة، على الهيكل الذي يتكون في الكون؛ بالنسبة للطاقة المظلمة، على كيفية تمدد الكون وتطور الإشعاع داخله - لكنهما يتصرفان بشكل مختلف تمامًا عن بعضهما البعض. أكبر الاختلافات هي:

- المادة المظلمة تتكتل، بينما يبدو أن الطاقة المظلمة موزعة بسلاسة في كل مكان من الفضاء،
- مع تمدد الكون، تصبح المادة المظلمة أقل كثافة، لكن كثافة الطاقة المظلمة تظل ثابتة،
- وتعمل المادة المظلمة على إبطاء تمدد الكون، بينما تعمل الطاقة المظلمة بنشاط على جعل المجرات البعيدة تبدو وكأنها تتسارع بينما تبتعد عنا.

يمكنك دائمًا صنع "نموذج موحد" للمادة المظلمة والطاقة المظلمة، وقد فعل العديد من الفيزيائيين ذلك، ولكن لا يوجد أي دافع مقنع للقيام بذلك. إذا كنت تعتقد أن هناك دافعًا، فسيتعين عليك تقديم إجابة مقنعة للسؤال التالي:

"لماذا يكون من الأكثر إقناعًا تقديم مكون جديد موحد له معلمتان حرتان - واحدة لشرح آثار 'المادة المظلمة' وأخرى لشرح آثار 'الطاقة المظلمة' - من تقديم مكونين مستقلين يتطوران بشكل مستقل عن بعضهما البعض؟"

يبدو هذا السؤال مؤثرًا بشكل خاص عندما ننظر إلى كيفية تطور المادة المظلمة والطاقة المظلمة من حيث الأهمية النسبية (من حيث النسبة المئوية لكثافة الطاقة التي يشكلانها) كدالة للوقت. منذ أن كان عمر الكون بضعة عشرات الآلاف من السنين حتى حوالي ~7 مليارات سنة، شكلت المادة المظلمة ~80٪ من كثافة طاقة الكون. على مدى ~6 مليارات سنة الماضية، أصبحت الطاقة المظلمة تهيمن على تمدد الكون، وهي تشكل الآن حوالي ~70٪ من إجمالي كمية الطاقة في الكون.

مع استمرار الوقت، ستصبح الطاقة المظلمة أكثر أهمية، بينما تصبح جميع أشكال الطاقة الأخرى، بما في ذلك المادة المظلمة، ضئيلة. إذا كانت المادة المظلمة والطاقة المظلمة مرتبطتان بطريقة ما ببعضهما البعض، فإن هذه العلاقة دقيقة وغير واضحة للفيزيائيين نظرًا لفهمنا الحالي للطبيعة. بالنسبة للمادة المظلمة، يجب أن تضيف مكونًا إضافيًا يجذب إلى كتل، لكنه لا يصطدم ولا يمارس ضغطًا. بالنسبة للطاقة المظلمة، لا يتكتل هذا المكون ولا يصطدم، لكنه يمارس ضغطًا.

هل هما مرتبطان؟ لا يمكننا الجزم بذلك. حتى يكون لدينا بعض الأدلة على أن هذين الأمرين مرتبطان بالفعل بطريقة ما، علينا أن نأخذ النهج المتحفظ. تشكل المادة المظلمة وتتماسك أكبر الهياكل المترابطة، لكن الطاقة المظلمة تدفع هذه الهياكل الفردية بعيدًا عن بعضها البعض. هذا الأخير ناجح لدرجة أنه في حوالي 100 مليار سنة، كل ما سيبقى من كوننا المرئي هو المجموعة المحلية من المجرات. بعد ذلك، لن يكون هناك سوى امتداد فارغ من العدم، بدون أي مجرات أخرى مرئية لتريليونات وتريليونات من السنين الضوئية.`,

But on the other side, the scientific community stands with a clear position: what is known as astrology is not a science, and is not based on any reliable empirical evidence.

In this article, we examine the roots of the astrology phenomenon and the scientific evidence associated with it, using studies in astronomy and psychology to answer the question "Do stars have any effect on humans?"

## Astrology and Horoscopes

### What is the scientific classification of astrology?

Astrology is globally classified under what is known as Pseudoscience, a classification that doesn't come from an ideological position, but from precise philosophical and scientific criteria.

According to a research paper published by Canada's University of Waterloo, astrology fails to meet a fundamental condition of science: falsifiability or testability, which is the criterion established by Austrian philosopher of science Karl Popper to distinguish science from non-science.

According to the same paper, Popper considered astrology "the clearest example of non-scientific theories," because its predictions are formulated in such a vague way that they appear correct in all cases, and therefore cannot be tested or proven wrong.

In this context, Hisham Ben Yahia, vice president of the Tunisian Astronomy Society, explained to the media that the end of each calendar year witnesses remarkable interest from some media outlets in astrologers and fortune-tellers under the pretext of exploring what stars and planets carry as "predictions" for the new year, with these individuals sometimes presented as astronomers, which perpetuates a common confusion among the public between astrology and astronomy.

Ben Yahia clarified that astronomy is an independent academic science specializing in studying celestial bodies and phenomena occurring outside Earth's atmosphere, taught in the world's most prestigious universities, with its name originating from "al-falak" meaning what revolves, and "falak" being the path of a planet.

In contrast, astrology relies on employing the apparent positions of stars, planets, and galaxies to predict future events and their alleged influence on human life, which leads some to believe that astrology is a science based on fixed foundations, while in reality it is not based on any scientific basis, but rather consists of astrologers drawing baseless opinions, often for purely material motives.

He added that modern sciences have definitively proven that there is no correlation between human destiny or future and the movement of stars, making the predictions promoted by astrologers without any scientific basis, relying solely on exploiting psychological factors and individuals' personal beliefs, while completely ignoring scientific evidence that contradicts them.

In the same framework, the French Academy of Sciences declared since its founding in 1666, in a historical report published by World Socialist Web Site, and by decision of King Louis XIV's minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert, its official rejection of astrology and prohibition of its teaching, considering it a non-scientific practice not based on evidence.

### No scientific evidence for horoscope influence on personality or destiny

Despite widespread belief that horoscopes determine human personality or life path, scientific studies have found no measurable relationship between the two. A recent study published in 2024 in the scientific journal Kyklos indicates that there is no statistically significant correlation between zodiac signs and happiness, mental health, financial satisfaction, and general health.

According to the study, which relied on data from over 12,000 participants in a broad representative social survey, the predictive power of horoscopes for individuals' moods or life events is "almost equivalent to a random variable."

The study confirms that any feeling of alignment between astrological predictions and reality is not due to the accuracy of horoscopes, but to known psychological factors, such as confirmation bias.

Ben Yahia believes that astronomy is an independent science concerned with studying celestial bodies and phenomena occurring outside Earth's atmosphere, and has no connection to astrology based on alleged predictions lacking any scientific basis.

He pointed out that confusion between astrology and astronomy recurs among a segment of people, benefiting astrologers who exploit prominent astronomical events to appear in the media, especially with the arrival of the New Year, leading to their dominance over wide spaces in national and international media, contributing to deepening the gap between the public and correct scientific knowledge, in addition to perpetuating this confusion.

He added that stars and star constellations are very far from Earth, separated by vast distances estimated at millions of light-years, explaining that the closest star to Earth in the Milky Way galaxy reaches us after four years, meaning its distance is measured as four light-years.

Considering these enormous distances, he emphasized that there can be no talk of any actual influence of stars on human life, except for their aesthetic role in decorating the sky throughout the seasons. He reminded that ancestors benefited from stars in many aspects of daily life, such as travel, navigation, and architecture, in addition to determining prayer times in Islam, and some of these uses continue to this day in some societies.

### Scientific experiments failed to prove astrology

Attempts to scientifically test astrology are not new. Among the most famous experiments in this field is a study conducted in 1985 and published in the scientific journal Nature, where a number of astrologers underwent a double-blind test to evaluate their ability to match astrological charts with real personality descriptions.

According to the experiment results, astrologers failed to provide predictions more accurate than random guessing, leading the researcher to conclude that "the astrological hypothesis was not experimentally supported."

Other studies, including research by Dutch psychologist Peter Hartmann, based on analysis of two large samples (over 15,000 people), found no significant correlation between birth date and individual differences in personality or intelligence, and no scientific support for astrological predictions about zodiac signs and their influence on human traits.

Ben Yahia explained in the same context that astrology remained prevalent until around the 16th century, and although the first separation between it and astronomy dates back to about fifty years BC, this association remained entrenched in human minds until the physicist-astronomer Isaac Newton came, proving that the falling of objects on Earth and the movement of celestial bodies are subject to the same law, the law of universal gravitation, which overthrew the idea of "fixity of things" that astrologers believe in.

Newton also proved that the movement of celestial bodies is governed by precise scientific laws and principles, allowing calculation of their positions in advance with extreme accuracy.

He continued that the great development achieved by astronomy through the ages contrasts with astrology's reliance on obsolete techniques closer to sorcery than scientific methodology. Astrologers still rely on a fixed celestial sphere whose observations date back about two thousand years, and they divide the zodiac into only twelve signs, while modern observations have proven that the sun, during its apparent annual path, passes through thirteen constellations, and astrologers' insistence on ignoring this is only to facilitate their erroneous calculations.

Ben Yahia concluded by emphasizing that the renewed conflict between astronomers and astrologers is essentially a methodological conflict, aiming to establish scientific awareness and elevate knowledge based on facts.

### NASA settles the debate: Astrology is not science

One of the entities whose name is most misused in promoting horoscopes is the American space agency (NASA). According to an official clarification by the agency, astronomy is the scientific study of celestial bodies using physics and observation, while astrology is "a belief system not based on scientific evidence."

NASA confirmed that horoscopes are not based on known physical forces, and that star positions do not affect human personality.

According to a verification report previously published by the media, NASA denied the validity of circulating claims about "adding a new sign" or "changing horoscopes," clarifying that these divisions were never scientific.

### Why do people believe in horoscopes despite the lack of evidence?

Psychologists believe that belief in horoscopes is not due to their accuracy, but to known psychological mechanisms, as humans tend to believe general descriptions they think are personally directed to them.

This is known as the Barnum effect, where horoscope predictions are formulated in vague phrases that could apply to anyone.

People also tend to remember predictions that "came true" and ignore dozens of cases where no prophecy materialized. In times of anxiety and uncertainty, individuals seek simple explanations that give them a sense of control, even if unscientific.

Psychological research also indicates that reading positive predictions may temporarily improve mood, not because of their accuracy, but due to psychological suggestion.

## Historical roots of astrology: From celestial observation to organized superstition

The emergence of astrology dates back to ancient times, before the emergence of science in the modern sense, when humans tried to interpret natural and cosmic phenomena based on observation and symbolic interpretation. According to historical studies published in the scientific encyclopedia Britannica, astrology originated in Mesopotamian civilization (Babylonian) over 3,000 years ago, when priests (astronomers at the time) observed the movement of planets and stars to use them in predicting major events like wars, famines, and the fate of kings, not individual destinies as is common today.

According to the same encyclopedia, astrology in its beginnings was not separate from astronomy; the two were part of a single knowledge system, as there were no scientific tools or physical concepts allowing separation between observation and interpretation.

With the transfer of Babylonian knowledge to Greek civilization, especially during the 4th century BC, astrology developed to take on a philosophical character. According to science historian James Evans, the Greeks relied on precise astronomical calculations but added an interpretive dimension, considering the universe a harmonious system whose parts influence each other, including humans.

Then during the golden age of Islamic civilization, astronomy witnessed significant development based on observation and calculation, while astrology began to lose its scientific standing.

According to history of science studies published on the scientific press site of Cambridge University, several Muslim scholars clearly distinguished between astronomy and astrology. Ibn Sina criticized astrology, considering linking human actions to the movement of celestial bodies "a claim not based on rational necessity nor sensory experience."

Ibn Rushd also rejected the idea that planets have direct causal ability on human actions, emphasizing that this contradicts reason and demonstrative methodology.

Science historians point out that these criticisms represent early beginnings of conceptual separation between astronomy as a scientific discipline and astrology as an unproven interpretive practice.

Science historians agree that the decisive separation between astronomy and astrology occurred during the 16th and 17th centuries, with the emergence of the modern scientific method. According to the encyclopedia, the work of scientists like Nicolaus Copernicus, Galileo Galilei, Johannes Kepler, and Isaac Newton transformed the study of the sky from symbolic interpretation to a science based on precise observation, mathematics, and physical laws.

Although some of these scientists practiced astrology in their beginnings, their scientific work itself contributed to undermining the philosophical foundations of astrology, leaving no room for assuming supernatural influence of planets on human behavior.

### 17th century: Astrology outside scientific institutions

This separation peaked with the establishment of modern scientific institutions. According to historical documentation, the French Academy of Sciences declared since its founding in 1666 the exclusion of astrology from research and education fields, considered a decisive institutional step to separate science from untestable beliefs.

By the 18th century, astronomy became an independent science taught in universities and used in navigation and calendars, while astrology declined to the margins of popular culture.

However, despite this clear scientific separation, astrology reappeared in the 20th century, not as a science, but as a cultural and media product. Sociological studies published in the Journal of Popular Culture spoke of the association of horoscope spread with newspapers, then radio and television, and finally social media platforms, where predictions are presented in an entertainment format not subject to any scientific scrutiny.

Researchers confirm that this return does not reflect cognitive development, but rather the transformation of astrology into a content industry benefiting from collective anxiety and psychological need for explanation.`,

Mais de l'autre côté, la communauté scientifique se tient avec une position claire : ce qui est connu sous le nom d'astrologie n'est pas une science et ne repose sur aucune preuve empirique fiable.

Dans cet article, nous examinons les racines du phénomène astrologique et les preuves scientifiques qui y sont associées, en utilisant des études en astronomie et en psychologie pour répondre à la question "Les étoiles ont-elles un effet sur les humains ?"

## Astrologie et horoscopes

### Quelle est la classification scientifique de l'astrologie ?

L'astrologie est classée mondialement dans ce qu'on appelle la Pseudoscience, une classification qui ne vient pas d'une position idéologique, mais de critères philosophiques et scientifiques précis.

Selon un article de recherche publié par l'Université de Waterloo au Canada, l'astrologie échoue à satisfaire une condition fondamentale de la science : la falsifiabilité ou la testabilité, qui est le critère établi par le philosophe des sciences autrichien Karl Popper pour distinguer la science de la non-science.

Selon le même article, Popper considérait l'astrologie comme "l'exemple le plus clair de théories non scientifiques", car ses prédictions sont formulées de manière si vague qu'elles apparaissent correctes dans tous les cas, et ne peuvent donc pas être testées ou prouvées fausses.

Dans ce contexte, Hisham Ben Yahia, vice-président de la Société tunisienne d'astronomie, a expliqué aux médias que la fin de chaque année civile témoigne d'un intérêt remarquable de certains médias pour les astrologues et les diseurs de bonne aventure sous prétexte d'explorer ce que les étoiles et les planètes portent comme "prédictions" pour la nouvelle année, ces individus étant parfois présentés comme des astronomes, ce qui perpétue une confusion courante chez le public entre l'astrologie et l'astronomie.

Ben Yahia a clarifié que l'astronomie est une science académique indépendante spécialisée dans l'étude des corps célestes et des phénomènes se produisant en dehors de l'atmosphère terrestre, enseignée dans les universités les plus prestigieuses du monde, son nom provenant de "al-falak" signifiant ce qui tourne, et "falak" étant le chemin d'une planète.

En revanche, l'astrologie repose sur l'utilisation des positions apparentes des étoiles, des planètes et des galaxies pour prédire les événements futurs et leur influence présumée sur la vie humaine, ce qui conduit certains à croire que l'astrologie est une science basée sur des fondements fixes, alors qu'en réalité elle ne repose sur aucune base scientifique, mais consiste plutôt en des astrologues tirant des opinions sans fondement, souvent pour des motifs purement matériels.

Il a ajouté que les sciences modernes ont définitivement prouvé qu'il n'y a aucune corrélation entre le destin humain ou l'avenir et le mouvement des étoiles, rendant les prédictions promues par les astrologues sans aucune base scientifique, s'appuyant uniquement sur l'exploitation de facteurs psychologiques et des croyances personnelles des individus, tout en ignorant complètement les preuves scientifiques qui les contredisent.

Dans le même cadre, l'Académie française des sciences a déclaré depuis sa fondation en 1666, dans un rapport historique publié par World Socialist Web Site, et par décision du ministre de Louis XIV Jean-Baptiste Colbert, son rejet officiel de l'astrologie et l'interdiction de son enseignement, la considérant comme une pratique non scientifique ne reposant pas sur des preuves.

### Aucune preuve scientifique de l'influence des horoscopes sur la personnalité ou le destin

Malgré la croyance répandue que les horoscopes déterminent la personnalité humaine ou le parcours de vie, les études scientifiques n'ont trouvé aucune relation mesurable entre les deux. Une étude récente publiée en 2024 dans la revue scientifique Kyklos indique qu'il n'y a aucune corrélation statistiquement significative entre les signes du zodiaque et le bonheur, la santé mentale, la satisfaction financière et la santé générale.

Selon l'étude, qui s'est appuyée sur des données de plus de 12 000 participants à une vaste enquête sociale représentative, le pouvoir prédictif des horoscopes pour l'humeur des individus ou les événements de la vie est "presque équivalent à une variable aléatoire".

L'étude confirme que tout sentiment d'alignement entre les prédictions astrologiques et la réalité n'est pas dû à l'exactitude des horoscopes, mais à des facteurs psychologiques connus, comme le biais de confirmation.

Ben Yahia estime que l'astronomie est une science indépendante concernée par l'étude des corps célestes et des phénomènes se produisant en dehors de l'atmosphère terrestre, et n'a aucun lien avec l'astrologie basée sur des prédictions présumées manquant de toute base scientifique.

Il a souligné que la confusion entre astrologie et astronomie se reproduit chez un segment de la population, profitant aux astrologues qui exploitent les événements astronomiques marquants pour apparaître dans les médias, surtout à l'arrivée du Nouvel An, conduisant à leur domination sur de vastes espaces dans les médias nationaux et internationaux, contribuant à approfondir le fossé entre le public et la connaissance scientifique correcte, en plus de perpétuer cette confusion.

Il a ajouté que les étoiles et les constellations stellaires sont très éloignées de la Terre, séparées par de vastes distances estimées à des millions d'années-lumière, expliquant que l'étoile la plus proche de la Terre dans la galaxie de la Voie lactée nous atteint après quatre ans, ce qui signifie que sa distance est mesurée à quatre années-lumière.

Compte tenu de ces distances énormes, il a souligné qu'on ne peut pas parler d'une influence réelle des étoiles sur la vie humaine, à l'exception de leur rôle esthétique dans la décoration du ciel tout au long des saisons. Il a rappelé que les ancêtres ont bénéficié des étoiles dans de nombreux aspects de la vie quotidienne, comme les voyages, la navigation et l'architecture, en plus de déterminer les heures de prière dans l'islam, et certaines de ces utilisations continuent à ce jour dans certaines sociétés.

### Expériences scientifiques n'ayant pas réussi à prouver l'astrologie

Les tentatives de tester scientifiquement l'astrologie ne sont pas nouvelles. Parmi les expériences les plus célèbres dans ce domaine, une étude menée en 1985 et publiée dans la revue scientifique Nature, où un certain nombre d'astrologues ont subi un test en double aveugle pour évaluer leur capacité à faire correspondre des cartes astrologiques avec des descriptions de personnalité réelles.

Selon les résultats de l'expérience, les astrologues n'ont pas réussi à fournir des prédictions plus précises qu'une devinette aléatoire, conduisant le chercheur à conclure que "l'hypothèse astrologique n'était pas soutenue expérimentalement".

D'autres études, dont les recherches du psychologue néerlandais Peter Hartmann, basées sur l'analyse de deux grands échantillons (plus de 15 000 personnes), n'ont trouvé aucune corrélation significative entre la date de naissance et les différences individuelles de personnalité ou d'intelligence, et aucun soutien scientifique aux prédictions astrologiques sur les signes du zodiaque et leur influence sur les traits humains.

Ben Yahia a expliqué dans le même contexte que l'astrologie est restée prévalente jusqu'au XVIe siècle environ, et bien que la première séparation entre elle et l'astronomie remonte à environ cinquante ans avant J.-C., cette association est restée ancrée dans les esprits humains jusqu'à ce que le physicien-astronome Isaac Newton arrive, prouvant que la chute des objets sur Terre et le mouvement des corps célestes sont soumis à la même loi, la loi de la gravitation universelle, ce qui a renversé l'idée de "fixité des choses" à laquelle croient les astrologues.

Newton a également prouvé que le mouvement des corps célestes est régi par des lois et des principes scientifiques précis, permettant le calcul de leurs positions à l'avance avec une extrême précision.

Il a poursuivi que le grand développement atteint par l'astronomie à travers les âges contraste avec la dépendance de l'astrologie à des techniques obsolètes plus proches de la sorcellerie que de la méthodologie scientifique. Les astrologues s'appuient encore sur une sphère céleste fixe dont les observations remontent à environ deux mille ans, et ils divisent le zodiaque en seulement douze signes, tandis que les observations modernes ont prouvé que le soleil, pendant son parcours annuel apparent, traverse treize constellations, et l'insistance des astrologues à ignorer cela n'est que pour faciliter leurs calculs erronés.

Ben Yahia a conclu en soulignant que le conflit renouvelé entre astronomes et astrologues est essentiellement un conflit méthodologique, visant à établir la conscience scientifique et à élever la connaissance basée sur les faits.

### La NASA règle le débat : L'astrologie n'est pas une science

L'une des entités dont le nom est le plus utilisé à mauvais escient dans la promotion des horoscopes est l'agence spatiale américaine (NASA). Selon une clarification officielle de l'agence, l'astronomie est l'étude scientifique des corps célestes utilisant la physique et l'observation, tandis que l'astrologie est "un système de croyance ne reposant pas sur des preuves scientifiques".

La NASA a confirmé que les horoscopes ne sont pas basés sur des forces physiques connues, et que les positions des étoiles n'affectent pas la personnalité humaine.

Selon un rapport de vérification précédemment publié par les médias, la NASA a nié la validité des affirmations circulant sur "l'ajout d'un nouveau signe" ou "le changement des horoscopes", précisant que ces divisions n'ont jamais été scientifiques.

### Pourquoi les gens croient-ils aux horoscopes malgré l'absence de preuves ?

Les psychologues estiment que la croyance aux horoscopes n'est pas due à leur exactitude, mais à des mécanismes psychologiques connus, car les humains ont tendance à croire des descriptions générales qu'ils pensent personnellement dirigées vers eux.

C'est ce qu'on appelle l'effet Barnum, où les prédictions horoscopiques sont formulées en phrases vagues qui pourraient s'appliquer à n'importe qui.

Les gens ont aussi tendance à se souvenir des prédictions qui "se sont réalisées" et à ignorer des dizaines de cas où aucune prophétie ne s'est matérialisée. En période d'anxiété et d'incertitude, les individus recherchent des explications simples qui leur donnent un sentiment de contrôle, même si non scientifiques.

La recherche psychologique indique également que la lecture de prédictions positives peut temporairement améliorer l'humeur, non pas à cause de leur exactitude, mais en raison de la suggestion psychologique.

## Racines historiques de l'astrologie : De l'observation céleste à la superstition organisée

L'émergence de l'astrologie remonte aux temps anciens, avant l'émergence de la science au sens moderne, lorsque les humains tentaient d'interpréter les phénomènes naturels et cosmiques basés sur l'observation et l'interprétation symbolique. Selon des études historiques publiées dans l'encyclopédie scientifique Britannica, l'astrologie est née dans la civilisation mésopotamienne (babylonienne) il y a plus de 3 000 ans, lorsque les prêtres (astronomes à l'époque) observaient le mouvement des planètes et des étoiles pour les utiliser dans la prédiction d'événements majeurs comme les guerres, les famines et le destin des rois, pas les destins individuels comme c'est courant aujourd'hui.

Selon la même encyclopédie, l'astrologie à ses débuts n'était pas séparée de l'astronomie ; les deux faisaient partie d'un système de connaissance unique, car il n'y avait pas d'outils scientifiques ou de concepts physiques permettant la séparation entre l'observation et l'interprétation.

Avec le transfert des connaissances babyloniennes à la civilisation grecque, surtout pendant le 4ème siècle avant J.-C., l'astrologie s'est développée pour prendre un caractère philosophique. Selon l'historien des sciences James Evans, les Grecs s'appuyaient sur des calculs astronomiques précis mais ajoutaient une dimension interprétative, considérant l'univers comme un système harmonieux dont les parties s'influencent mutuellement, y compris les humains.

Puis pendant l'âge d'or de la civilisation islamique, l'astronomie a connu un développement significatif basé sur l'observation et le calcul, tandis que l'astrologie commençait à perdre sa position scientifique.

Selon des études d'histoire des sciences publiées sur le site de presse scientifique de l'Université de Cambridge, plusieurs érudits musulmans ont clairement distingué entre astronomie et astrologie. Ibn Sina a critiqué l'astrologie, considérant que lier les actions humaines au mouvement des corps célestes était "une affirmation ne reposant sur aucune nécessité rationnelle ni expérience sensorielle".

Ibn Rushd a également rejeté l'idée que les planètes ont une capacité causale directe sur les actions humaines, soulignant que cela contredit la raison et la méthodologie démonstrative.

Les historiens des sciences soulignent que ces critiques représentent des débuts précoces de séparation conceptuelle entre l'astronomie en tant que discipline scientifique et l'astrologie en tant que pratique interprétative non prouvée.

Les historiens des sciences s'accordent à dire que la séparation décisive entre astronomie et astrologie s'est produite aux XVIe et XVIIe siècles, avec l'émergence de la méthode scientifique moderne. Selon l'encyclopédie, le travail de scientifiques comme Nicolas Copernic, Galilée, Johannes Kepler et Isaac Newton a transformé l'étude du ciel d'une interprétation symbolique en une science basée sur l'observation précise, les mathématiques et les lois physiques.

Bien que certains de ces scientifiques aient pratiqué l'astrologie à leurs débuts, leur travail scientifique lui-même a contribué à saper les fondements philosophiques de l'astrologie, ne laissant aucune place à l'hypothèse d'une influence surnaturelle des planètes sur le comportement humain.

### XVIIe siècle : L'astrologie en dehors des institutions scientifiques

Cette séparation a culminé avec l'établissement des institutions scientifiques modernes. Selon la documentation historique, l'Académie française des sciences a déclaré depuis sa fondation en 1666 l'exclusion de l'astrologie des domaines de recherche et d'enseignement, considérée comme une étape institutionnelle décisive pour séparer la science des croyances non testables.

Au XVIIIe siècle, l'astronomie est devenue une science indépendante enseignée dans les universités et utilisée dans la navigation et les calendriers, tandis que l'astrologie déclinait aux marges de la culture populaire.

Cependant, malgré cette séparation scientifique claire, l'astrologie est réapparue au XXe siècle, non pas comme une science, mais comme un produit culturel et médiatique. Des études sociologiques publiées dans le Journal of Popular Culture ont parlé de l'association de la diffusion des horoscopes avec les journaux, puis la radio et la télévision, et enfin les plateformes de médias sociaux, où les prédictions sont présentées dans un format de divertissement non soumis à un examen scientifique.

Les chercheurs confirment que ce retour ne reflète pas un développement cognitif, mais plutôt la transformation de l'astrologie en une industrie de contenu bénéficiant de l'anxiété collective et du besoin psychologique d'explication.`,

لكن في الجهة المقابلة، يقف المجتمع العلمي بمؤسساته وبحوثه موقفًا واضحًا: ما يُعرف بالتنجيم ليس علمًا، ولا يستند إلى أي دليل تجريبي موثوق.

في هذا المقال، يفحص مسبار جذور ظاهرة التنجيم والأدلة العلمية المرتبطة بها، مستعينًا بدراسات بعلم الفلك وعلم النفس للإجابة عن سؤال "هل للنجوم أي تأثير على البشر".

## التنجيم والأبراج

### ما هو التصنيف العلمي للتنجيم؟

يُصنَّف التنجيم عالميًا ضمن ما يُعرف بـ العلوم الزائفة (Pseudoscience)، وهو تصنيف لا يأتي من موقف أيديولوجي، بل من معايير فلسفية وعلمية دقيقة.

فبحسب ورقة بحثية منشورة عن جامعة واترلو الكندي، فإن التنجيم يفشل في تحقيق شرط أساسي من شروط العلم، وهو قابلية التفنيد أو الاختبار، وهو المعيار الذي وضعه فيلسوف العلم النمساوي كارل بوبر لتمييز العلم عن غيره.

ووفق الورقة نفسها، اعتبر بوبر أن التنجيم "أوضح مثال على النظريات غير العلمية"، لأن توقعاته مصاغة بطريقة فضفاضة تجعلها صحيحة ظاهريًا في جميع الحالات، وبالتالي لا يمكن اختبارها أو إثبات خطئها.

في هذا الصدد، أوضح هشام بن يحيى، نائب رئيس الجمعية التونسية لعلوم الفلك، في حديثه لمسبار، أن نهاية كل سنة ميلادية تشهد إقبالًا لافتًا من عدد من وسائل الإعلام على المنجمين والعرافين بدعوى استشراف ما تحمله النجوم والكواكب من "توقّعات" للسنة الجديدة، ليُقدَّم هؤلاء أحيانًا في صورة علماء فلك، وهو ما يكرّس خلطًا شائعًا لدى الجمهور بين التنجيم وعلم الفلك.

وبيّن بن يحيى أن علم الفلك هو علم أكاديمي قائم بذاته، يختص بدراسة الأجرام والظواهر التي تنشأ خارج الغلاف الجوي للأرض، ويُدرَّس في أعرق الجامعات العالمية، ويعود أصل تسميته إلى "الفلكة" أي ما استدار من الشيء، والفلك هو مسار الكوكب.

في المقابل، يعتمد التنجيم على توظيف المواقع الظاهرة للنجوم والكواكب والمجرّات للتنبؤ بأحداث مستقبلية وتأثيرها المزعوم على حياة الإنسان، وهو ما يدفع البعض إلى الاعتقاد بأن التنجيم علم قائم على أسس ثابتة، في حين أنه في الواقع لا يستند إلى أي قاعدة علمية، بل يقوم على استخلاص المنجم آراء لا أساس لها، غالبًا بدافع مادي بحت.

وأضاف أن العلوم الحديثة أثبتت بشكل قاطع عدم وجود أي علاقة ارتباطية بين مصير الإنسان أو مستقبله وحركة النجوم، ما يجعل التوقّعات التي يروّج لها المنجمون بلا أي سند علمي، ولا تقوم إلا على استغلال العوامل النفسية والمعتقدات الشخصية للأفراد، مع تجاهل تام للأدلة العلمية التي تناقضها.

في الإطار نفسه، أعلنت الأكاديمية الفرنسية للعلوم منذ تأسيسها عام 1666، في تقرير تاريخي نشره موقع World Socialist Web Site، وبقرار من وزير الملك لويس الرابع عشر جان باتيست كولبير، رفضها الرسمي للتنجيم ومنع تدريسه، معتبرة إياه ممارسة غير علمية لا تستند إلى البرهان.

### لا دليلًا علميًا على تأثير الأبراج على الشخصية أو المصير

رغم شيوع الاعتقاد بأن الأبراج تحدد شخصية الإنسان أو مسار حياته، فإن الدراسات العلمية لم تعثر على أي علاقة قابلة للقياس بين الأمرين، وتشير دراسة حديثة نُشرت سنة 2024 في مجلة Kyklos العلمية، إلى أنه لا يوجد أي ارتباط إحصائي مهم بين علامة البرج وكل من السعادة والصحة النفسية والرضا المالي والصحة العامة.

وبحسب الدراسة، التي اعتمدت على بيانات أكثر من 12 ألف مشارك ضمن استطلاع اجتماعي تمثيلي واسع، فإن قوة الأبراج في التنبؤ بمزاج الأفراد أو أحداث حياتهم "تكاد تكون مساوية لمتغير عشوائي".

وتؤكد الدراسة أن أي شعور بتطابق التوقعات الفلكية مع الواقع لا يعود إلى دقة الأبراج، بل إلى عوامل نفسية معروفة، مثل التحيز التأكيدي.

ويرى هشام بن يحيى، أن علم الفلك يُعد علمًا قائمًا بذاته، يُعنى بدراسة الأجرام السماوية والظواهر التي تحدث خارج الغلاف الجوي للأرض، ولا يمت بصلة إلى التنجيم القائم على توقّعات مزعومة تفتقر لأي أساس علمي.

وأشار إلى أن الخلط بين التنجيم وعلم الفلك يتكرر لدى شريحة من الناس، مستفيدًا من ذلك المنجمون الذين يستغلون الأحداث الفلكية البارزة للظهور إعلاميًا، لا سيما مع حلول رأس السنة الميلادية، ما يفضي إلى هيمنتهم على مساحات واسعة في وسائل الإعلام الوطنية والدولية، ويُسهم في تعميق الفجوة بين الجمهور والمعرفة العلمية الصحيحة، فضلًا عن تكريس هذا الالتباس.

وأضاف أن النجوم والأبراج النجمية بعيدة جدًا عن الأرض، إذ تفصلها عنها مسافات شاسعة تُقدَّر بملايين السنين الضوئية، موضحًا أن أقرب نجم إلى الأرض في مجرّة درب التبانة يصل ضوؤه إلينا بعد أربع سنوات، وهو ما يعني أن بُعده يُقاس بأربع سنوات ضوئية.

وبالنظر إلى هذه المسافات الهائلة، شدد على أنه لا يمكن الحديث عن أي تأثير فعلي للنجوم على حياة البشر، باستثناء دورها الجمالي في تزيين السماء على مدار الفصول. وذكّر بأن الأجداد استفادوا من النجوم في عديد من مناحي الحياة اليومية، مثل السفر والتنقّل والملاحة والعمارة، إضافة إلى تحديد أوقات الصلوات في الإسلام، ولا تزال بعض هذه الاستخدامات قائمة إلى اليوم لدى عدد من المجتمعات.

### تجارب علمية أخفقت في إثبات التنجيم

تعد محاولات اختبار التنجيم علميًا ليست جديدة، فمن أشهر التجارب في هذا المجال، دراسة أجريت سنة 1985 ونُشرت في مجلة Nature العلمية، حيث خضع عدد من المنجمين لاختبار مزدوج التعمية لتقييم قدرتهم على مطابقة خرائط فلكية مع أوصاف شخصية حقيقة.

وبحسب نتائج التجربة، لم ينجح المنجمون في تقديم تنبؤات أدق من التخمين العشوائي، وهو ما دفع الباحث إلى الاستنتاج بأن "الفرضية الفلكية لم تُدعَم تجريبيًا".

كما توصلت دراسات أخرى، من بينها أبحاث عالم النفس الهولندي بيتر هارتمان، بناء على تحليل عينتين كبيرتين (أكثر من 15,000 شخص)، أنه لا يوجد ارتباط مهم بين تاريخ الميلاد وبين الفروق الفردية في الشخصية أو الذكاء، ولا دعم علمي لتنبؤات التنجيم حول الأبراج وتأثيرها على الصفات البشرية.

وأوضح بن يحيى في السياق نفسه، أن التنجيم ظل سائدًا إلى حدود القرن السادس عشر، ورغم أن أول انفصال بينه وبين علم الفلك يعود إلى نحو خمسين سنة قبل الميلاد، فإن هذا الاقتران بقي راسخًا في أذهان البشر إلى أن جاء العالم الفيزيائي الفلكي إسحاق نيوتن، الذي أثبت أن سقوط الأجسام على الأرض وحركة الأجرام السماوية تخضع للقانون نفسه، أي قانون الجاذبية الكونية، وهو ما أسقط فكرة "ثبوتية الأشياء" التي يؤمن بها المنجمون.

كما أثبت نيوتن أن حركة الأجرام السماوية تحكمها قوانين ومبادئ علمية دقيقة، ما يسمح بحساب مواقعها مسبقًا بدقة متناهية.

وتابع أن التطور الكبير الذي بلغه علم الفلك عبر العصور يقابله اعتماد التنجيم على تقنيات بالية أقرب إلى الشعوذة منها إلى المنهج العلمي، إذ ما يزال المنجمون يستندون إلى كرة سماوية ثابتة تعود ملاحظاتها إلى ما يقارب ألفي سنة، ويعتمدون تقسيم الأبراج إلى اثني عشر برجًا فقط، في حين أثبتت الأرصاد الحديثة أن الشمس، خلال مسارها الظاهري السنوي، تمر عبر ثلاثة عشر برجًا، وما إصرار المنجمين على تجاهل ذلك إلا تسهيلًا لحساباتهم الخاطئة.

وختم بن يحيى بالتأكيد على أن الصراع المتجدّد بين الفلكيين والمنجمين هو في جوهره صراع منهج، يهدف إلى تكريس الوعي العلمي والارتقاء بالمعرفة القائمة على الحقائق.

### ناسا تحسم الجدل: التنجيم ليس علمًا

من أكثر الجهات التي يُساء استخدام اسمها في ترويج الأبراج هي وكالة الفضاء الأميركية (NASA)، وبحسب توضيح رسمي للوكالة، فإن علم الفلك هو دراسة علمية للأجرام السماوية باستخدام الفيزياء والرصد، بينما التنجيم "نظام اعتقادي لا يستند إلى أدلة علمية".

وأكدت ناسا أن الأبراج ليست قائمة على قوى فيزيائية معروفة، وأن مواقع النجوم لا تؤثر على شخصية الإنسان.

ووفق تقرير تحقق كان قد نشره موقع مسبار، نفت ناسا صحة الادعاءات المتداولة حول "إضافة برج جديد" أو "تغيير الأبراج"، موضحة أن هذه التقسيمات لم تكن يومًا علمية.

### لماذا يصدق الناس الأبراج على الرغم من غياب الأدلة؟

يرى علماء النفس أن الإيمان بالأبراج لا يعود إلى صحتها، بل إلى آليات نفسية معروفة إذ يميل البشر إلى تصديق أوصاف عامة يعتقدون أنها موجهة لهم شخصيًا.

 وهو ما يُعرف بتأثير بارنوم، إذ تُصاغ توقعات الأبراج بعبارات فضفاضة يمكن أن تنطبق على أي شخص.

كما يميل الأشخاص إلى تذكر التوقعات التي "تحققت" وتجاهل عشرات الحالات التي لم تتحقق فيها أي نبوءة.وفي فترات القلق وعدم اليقين، يبحث الأفراد عن تفسيرات بسيطة تمنحهم شعورًا بالسيطرة، حتى لو كانت غير علمية.

وتشير الأبحاث النفسية أيضًا إلى أن قراءة توقعات إيجابية قد تحسن المزاج مؤقتًا، ليس بسبب صحتها، بل بسبب الإيحاء النفسي.

## الجذور التاريخية للتنجيم: من الملاحظة السماوية إلى الخرافة المنظَّمة

يعود ظهور التنجيم إلى العصور القديمة، قبل نشوء العلم بالمعنى الحديث، حين كان الإنسان يحاول تفسير الظواهر الطبيعية والكونية اعتمادًا على الملاحظة والتأويل الرمزي، فوفق دراسات تاريخية منشورة في الموسوعة العلمية بريتانيكا (Britannica)، نشأ التنجيم في حضارة بلاد الرافدين (البابلية) قبل أكثر من 3000 عام، حين كان الكهنة (لفلكيون آنذاك) يراقبون حركة الكواكب والنجوم لاستخدامها في التنبؤ بالأحداث الكبرى مثل الحروب والمجاعات ومصير الملوك، وليس مصائر الأفراد كما هو شائع اليوم.

وبحسب الموسوعة نفسها، لم يكن التنجيم في بداياته منفصلًا عن علم الفلك، بل كان الاثنان جزءًا من منظومة معرفية واحدة، إذ لم تكن هناك أدوات علمية أو مفاهيم فيزيائية تسمح بالفصل بين الرصد والتفسير.

مع انتقال المعارف البابلية إلى الحضارة اليونانية، خاصة خلال القرن الرابع قبل الميلاد، تطور التنجيم ليأخذ طابعًا فلسفيًا، ووفق مؤرخ العلوم جيمس إيفانز، اعتمد الإغريق على الحسابات الفلكية الدقيقة، لكنهم أضافوا إليها بعدًا تأويليًا، معتبرين أن الكون منظومة متناغمة تؤثر أجزاؤها في بعضها البعض، بما في ذلك البشر.

ثم خلال العصر الذهبي للحضارة الإسلامية، شهد علم الفلك تطورًا كبيرًا قائمًا على الرصد والحساب، بينما بدأ التنجيم يفقد مكانته العلمية.

وبحسب دراسات تاريخ العلوم المنشورة في موقع الصحافة العلمية التابع لجامعة كامبريدج، ميّز عدد من العلماء المسلمين بوضوح بين الفلك والتنجيم، إذ انتقد ابن سينا التنجيم، معتبرًا أن ربط أفعال البشر بحركة الأجرام السماوية "ادعاء لا يقوم على ضرورة عقلية ولا تجربة حسية".

كما رفض ابن رشد فكرة أن للكواكب قدرة سببية مباشرة على أفعال الإنسان، مؤكدًا أن ذلك يتعارض مع العقل والمنهج البرهاني.

ويُشير مؤرخو العلم إلى أن هذه الانتقادات تمثل بدايات مبكرة للفصل المفاهيمي بين علم الفلك كتخصص علمي، والتنجيم كممارسة تأويلية غير مثبتة.

ويُجمع مؤرخو العلوم على أن الفصل الحاسم بين علم الفلك والتنجيم حدث خلال القرنين السادس عشر والسابع عشر، مع نشوء المنهج العلمي الحديث، فبحسب الموسوعة، أدى عمل علماء مثل نيكولا كوبرنيكوس وغاليليو غاليلي ويوهانس كبلر وإسحاق نيوتن، إلى تحويل دراسة السماء من تأويل رمزي إلى علم قائم على الملاحظة الدقيقة والرياضيات والقوانين الفيزيائية.

ورغم أن بعض هؤلاء العلماء مارسوا التنجيم في بداياتهم، فإن أعمالهم العلمية نفسها ساهمت في تقويض الأسس الفلسفية للتنجيم، إذ لم تترك أي مجال لافتراض تأثير غيبي للكواكب على السلوك البشري.

### القرن السابع عشر: التنجيم خارج المؤسسات العلمية

بلغ هذا الفصل ذروته مع تأسيس المؤسسات العلمية الحديثة، وبحسب التوثيق التاريخي، أعلنت الأكاديمية الفرنسية للعلوم منذ تأسيسها عام 1666 استبعاد التنجيم من مجالات البحث والتعليم، وهو ما اعتبر خطوة مؤسسية حاسمة لفصل العلم عن المعتقدات غير القابلة للاختبار.

وبحلول القرن الثامن عشر، أصبح علم الفلك علمًا مستقلًا يُدرس في الجامعات ويُستخدم في الملاحة والتقويم، بينما تراجع التنجيم إلى هامش الثقافة الشعبية.

ولكن، على الرغم من هذا الفصل العلمي الواضح، عاد التنجيم للظهور في القرن العشرين، لا بوصفه علمًا، بل كمنتج ثقافي وإعلامي، وتحدثت دراسات سوسيولوجية منشورة في Journal of Popular Culture، عن ارتباط انتشار الأبراج بالصحافة، ثم بالإذاعة والتلفزيون، وأخيرًا بمنصات التواصل الاجتماعي، حيث تُقدَّم التوقعات في قالب ترفيهي لا يخضع لأي تدقيق علمي.

ويؤكد الباحثون أن هذه العودة لا تعكس تطورًا معرفيًا، بل تحول التنجيم إلى صناعة محتوى تستفيد من القلق الجماعي والحاجة النفسية للتفسير.`,
