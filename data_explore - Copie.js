            title: 'It all started with a Big Bang – the quest to unravel the mystery behind the birth of the universe',
            author: 'Konstantinos Dimopoulos',
            introduction: 'How did everything begin? It\'s a question that humans have pondered for thousands of years. Over the last century or so, science has homed in on an answer: the Big Bang.',
            excerpt: 'A look at the evidence for the Big Bang, the cosmic microwave background, and the quest to understand what happened at the very beginning of the universe.',
            body: `This describes how the Universe was born in a cataclysmic explosion almost 14 billion years ago. In a tiny fraction of a second, the observable universe grew by the equivalent of a bacterium expanding to the size of the Milky Way. The early universe was extraordinarily hot and extremely dense. But how do we know this happened?

Let's look first at the evidence. In 1929, the American astronomer Edwin Hubble discovered that distant galaxies are moving away from each other, leading to the realisation that the universe is expanding. If we were to wind the clock back to the birth of the cosmos, the expansion would reverse and the galaxies would fall on top of each other 14 billion years ago. This age agrees nicely with the ages of the oldest astronomical objects we observe.

The idea was initially met with scepticism – and it was actually a sceptic, the English astronomer Fred Hoyle, who coined the name. Hoyle sarcastically dismissed the hypothesis as a "Big Bang" during an interview with BBC radio on March 28 1949.

Then, in 1964, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson detected a particular type of radiation that fills all of space. This became known as the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. It is a kind of afterglow of the Big Bang explosion, released when the cosmos was a mere 380,000 years old.

The CMB provides a window into the hot, dense conditions at the beginning of the universe. Penzias and Wilson were awarded the 1978 Nobel Prize in Physics for their discovery.

More recently, experiments at particle accelerators like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have shed light on conditions even closer to the time of the Big Bang. Our understanding of physics at these high energies suggests that, in the very first moments after the Big Bang, the four fundamental forces of physics that exist today were initially combined in a single force.

The present day four forces are gravity, electromagnetism, the strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force. As the universe expanded and cooled down, a series of dramatic changes, called phase transitions (like the boiling or freezing of water), separated these forces.

Experiments at particle accelerators suggest that a few billionths of a second after the Big Bang, the latest of these phase transitions took place. This was the breakdown of electroweak unification, when electromagnetism and the weak nuclear force ceased to be combined. This is when all the matter in the Universe assumed its mass.

Moving on further in time, the universe is filled with a strange substance called quark-gluon plasma. As the name suggests, this "primordial soup" was made up of quarks and gluons. These are sub-atomic particles that are responsible for the strong nuclear force. Quark-gluon plasma was artificially generated in 2010 at the Brookhaven National Laboratory and in 2015 at the LHC.

Quarks and gluons have a strong attraction for one other and today are bound together as protons and neutrons, which in turn are the building blocks of atoms. However, in the hot and dense conditions of the early universe, they existed independently.

The quark-gluon plasma didn't last long. Just a few millionths of a second after the Big Bang, as the universe expanded and cooled, quarks and gluons clumped together as protons and neutrons, the situation that persists today. This event is called quark confinement.

As the universe expanded and cooled still further, there were fewer high energy photons (particles of light) in the universe than there had previously been. This is a trigger for the process called Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN). This is when the first atomic nuclei – the dense lumps of matter made of protons and neutrons and found at the centres of atoms – formed through nuclear fusion reactions, like those that power the Sun.

Back when there were more high energy photons in the universe, any atomic nuclei that formed would have been quickly destroyed by them (a process called photodisintegration). BBN ceased just a few minutes after the Big Bang, but its consequences are observable today.

Observations by astronomers have provided us with evidence for the primordial abundances of elements produced in these fusion reactions. The results closely agree with the theory of BBN. If we continued on, over nearly 14 billion years of time, we would reach the situation that exists today. But how close can we get to understanding what was happening near the moment of the Big Bang itself?

Scientists have no direct evidence for what came before the breakdown of electroweak unification (when electromagnetism and the weak nuclear force ceased to be combined). At such high energies and early times, we can only stare at the mystery of the Big Bang. So what does theory suggest?

When we go backwards in time through the history of the cosmos, the distances and volumes shrink, while the average energy density grows. At the Big Bang, distances and volumes drop to zero, all parts of the universe fall on top of each other and the energy density of the universe becomes infinite. Our mathematical equations, which describe the evolution of space and the expansion of the cosmos, become infested by zeros and infinities and stop making sense.

We call this a singularity. Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity describes how spacetime is shaped. Spacetime is a way of describing the three-dimensional geometry of the universe, blended with time. A curvature in spacetime gives rise to gravity.

But mathematics suggests there are places in the universe where the curvature of spacetime becomes unlimited. These locations are known as singularities. One such example can be found at the centre of a black hole. At these places, the theory of general relativity breaks down.

From 1965 to 1966, the British theoretical physicists Stephen Hawking and Roger Penrose presented a number of mathematical theorems demonstrating that the spacetime of an expanding universe must end at a singularity in the past: the Big Bang singularity.

Penrose received the Nobel Prize in 2020. Hawking passed away in 2018 and Nobel Prizes are not awarded posthumously. Space and time appear at the Big Bang singularity, so questions of what happens "before" the Big Bang are not well defined. As far as science can tell, there is no before; the Big Bang is the onset of time.

However, nature is not accurately described by general relativity alone, even though the latter has been around for more than 100 years and has not been disproven. General relativity cannot describe atoms, nuclear fusion or radioactivity. These phenomena are instead addressed by quantum theory.

Theories from "classical" physics, such as relativity, are deterministic. This means that certain initial conditions have a definite outcome and are therefore absolutely predictive. Quantum theory, on the other hand, is probabilistic. This means that certain initial conditions in the universe can have multiple outcomes.

Quantum theory is somewhat predictive, but in a probabilistic way. Outcomes are assigned a probability of existing. If the mathematical distribution of probabilities is sharply peaked at a certain outcome, then the situation is well described by a "classical" theory such as general relativity. But not all systems are like this. In some systems, for example atoms, the probability distribution is spread out and a classical description does not apply.

What about gravity? In the vast majority of cases, gravity is well described by classical physics. Classical spacetime is smooth. However, when curvature becomes extreme, near a singularity, then the quantum nature of gravity cannot be ignored. Here, spacetime is no longer smooth, but gnarly, similar to a carpet which looks smooth from afar but up-close is full of fibres and threads.

Thus, near the Big Bang singularity, the structure of spacetime ceases to be smooth. Mathematical theorems suggest that spacetime becomes overwhelmed by "gnarly" features: hooks, loops and bubbles. This rapidly fluctuating situation is called spacetime foam.

In spacetime foam, causality does not apply, because there are closed loops in spacetime where the future of an event is also its past (so its outcome can also be its cause). The probabilistic nature of quantum theory suggests that, when the probability distribution is evenly spread out, all outcomes are equally possible and the comfortable notion of causality we associate with a classical understanding of physics is lost.

Therefore, if we go back in time, just before we encounter the Big Bang singularity, we find ourselves entering an epoch where the quantum effects of gravity are dominant and causality does not apply. This is called the Planck epoch.

Time ceases to be linear, going from the past to the future, and instead becomes wrapped, chaotic and random. This means the question "why did the Big Bang occur?" has no meaning, because outside causality, events do not need a cause to take place.

In order to understand how physics works at a singularity like the Big Bang, we need a theory for how gravity behaves according to quantum theory. Unfortunately, we do not have one. There are a number of efforts on this front like loop quantum gravity and string theory, with its various incarnations.

However, these efforts are at best incomplete, because the problem is notoriously difficult. This means that spacetime foam has a totemic, powerful mystique, much like the ancient Chaos of Hesiod which the Greeks believed existed in the beginning.

So how did our expanding and largely classical universe ever escape from spacetime foam? This brings us to cosmic inflation. The latter is defined as a period of accelerated expansion in the early universe. It was first introduced by the Russian theoretical physicist Alexei Starobinsky in 1980 and in parallel, that same year, by the American physicist Alan Guth, who coined the name.

Inflation makes the universe large and uniform, according to observations. It also forces the universe to be spatially flat, which is an otherwise unstable situation, but which has also been confirmed by observations. Moreover, inflation provides a natural mechanism to generate the primordial irregularities in the density of the universe that are essential for structures such as galaxies and galaxy clusters to form.

Precision observations of the cosmic microwave background in recent decades have spectacularly confirmed the predictions of inflation. We also know that the universe can indeed undergo accelerated expansion, because in the last few billion years it started doing it again.

What does this have to do with spacetime foam? Well, it turns out that, if the conditions for inflation arise (by chance) in a patch of fluctuating spacetime, as can occur with spacetime foam, then this region inflates and starts conforming to classical physics.

According to an idea first proposed by the Russian-American physicist Andrei Linde, inflation is a natural – and perhaps inevitable – consequence of chaotic initial conditions in the early universe.

The point is that our classical universe could have emerged from chaotic conditions, like those in spacetime foam, by experiencing an initial boost of inflation. This would have set off the expansion of the universe. In fact, the observations by astronomers of the CMB suggest that the initial boost is explosive, since the expansion is exponential during inflation.

In March 20 of 2014, Alan Guth explained it succinctly: "I usually describe inflation as a theory of the 'bang' of the Big Bang: It describes the propulsion mechanism that we call the Big Bang."

So, there you have it. The 14 billion year story of our universe begins with a cataclysmic explosion everywhere in space, which we call the Big Bang. That much is beyond reasonable doubt. This explosion is really a period of explosive expansion, which we call cosmic inflation. What happens before inflation, though? Is it a spacetime singularity, is it spacetime foam? The answer is largely unknown.

In fact, it might even be unknowable, because there is a mathematical theorem which forbids us from accessing information about the onset of inflation, much like the one that prevents us from knowing about the interiors of black holes. So, from our point of view, cosmic inflation is the Big Bang, the explosion that started it all.

            title: 'Tout a commencé par un Big Bang – la quête pour percer le mystère de la naissance de l\'univers',
            author: 'Konstantinos Dimopoulos',
            introduction: 'Comment tout a-t-il commencé ? C\'est une question que les humains se posent depuis des milliers d\'années. Au cours du dernier siècle environ, la science s\'est concentrée sur une réponse : le Big Bang.',
            excerpt: 'Un examen des preuves du Big Bang, du fond diffus cosmologique et de la quête pour comprendre ce qui s\'est passé au tout début de l\'univers.',
            body: `Cette théorie décrit comment l\'Univers est né d\'une explosion cataclysmique il y a près de 14 milliards d\'années. En une fraction de seconde, l\'univers observable a grandi de l\'équivalent d\'une bactérie s\'étendant à la taille de la Voie Lactée. L\'univers primitif était extraordinairement chaud et extrêmement dense. Mais comment savons-nous que cela s\'est produit ?

Commençons par les preuves. En 1929, l\'astronome américain Edwin Hubble a découvert que les galaxies lointaines s\'éloignaient les unes des autres, conduisant à la réalisation que l\'univers est en expansion. Si nous remontions le temps jusqu\'à la naissance du cosmos, l\'expansion s\'inverserait et les galaxies tomberaient les unes sur les autres il y a 14 milliards d\'années. Cet âge correspond bien aux âges des plus vieux objets astronomiques que nous observons.

L\'idée a d\'abord été accueillie avec scepticisme – et c\'est en fait un sceptique, l\'astronome anglais Fred Hoyle, qui a inventé le nom. Hoyle a rejeté avec sarcasme l\'hypothèse comme un « Big Bang » lors d\'une interview à la BBC le 28 mars 1949.

Puis, en 1964, Arno Penzias et Robert Wilson ont détecté un type particulier de rayonnement qui remplit tout l\'espace. Cela est devenu connu sous le nom de rayonnement du fond diffus cosmologique (CMB). C\'est une sorte de rémanence de l\'explosion du Big Bang, libérée lorsque le cosmos n\'avait que 380 000 ans.

Le CMB fournit une fenêtre sur les conditions chaudes et denses au début de l\'univers. Penzias et Wilson ont reçu le prix Nobel de physique en 1978 pour leur découverte.

Plus récemment, des expériences dans des accélérateurs de particules comme le Grand collisionneur de hadrons (LHC) ont éclairé des conditions encore plus proches du moment du Big Bang. Notre compréhension de la physique à ces hautes énergies suggère que, dans les tout premiers instants après le Big Bang, les quatre forces fondamentales de la physique qui existent aujourd\'hui étaient initialement combinées en une seule force.

Les quatre forces actuelles sont la gravité, l\'électromagnétisme, la force nucléaire forte et la force nucléaire faible. Alors que l\'univers s\'est étendu et refroidi, une série de changements dramatiques, appelés transitions de phase (comme l\'ébullition ou la congélation de l\'eau), ont séparé ces forces.

Des expériences dans des accélérateurs de particules suggèrent que quelques milliardièmes de seconde après le Big Bang, la dernière de ces transitions de phase a eu lieu. C\'était la rupture de l\'unification électrofaible, lorsque l\'électromagnétisme et la force nucléaire faible ont cessé d\'être combinés. C\'est à ce moment-là que toute la matière dans l\'Univers a assumé sa masse.

En avançant davantage dans le temps, l\'univers est rempli d\'une substance étrange appelée plasma quark-gluon. Comme son nom l\'indique, cette « soupe primordiale » était composée de quarks et de gluons. Ce sont des particules subatomiques responsables de la force nucléaire forte. Le plasma quark-gluon a été généré artificiellement en 2010 au Brookhaven National Laboratory et en 2015 au LHC.

Les quarks et les gluons ont une forte attraction les uns pour les autres et aujourd\'hui sont liés ensemble sous forme de protons et de neutrons, qui à leur tour sont les blocs de construction des atomes. Cependant, dans les conditions chaudes et denses de l\'univers primitif, ils existaient indépendamment.

Le plasma quark-gluon n\'a pas duré longtemps. Seulement quelques millionièmes de seconde après le Big Bang, alors que l\'univers s\'étendait et se refroidissait, les quarks et les gluons se sont regroupés en protons et neutrons, situation qui persiste aujourd\'hui. Cet événement est appelé confinement des quarks.

Alors que l\'univers continuait à s\'étendre et à se refroidir encore plus, il y avait moins de photons à haute énergie (particules de lumière) dans l\'univers qu\'auparavant. C\'est un déclencheur pour le processus appelé nucléosynthèse primordiale (BBN). C\'est à ce moment que les premiers noyaux atomiques – les morceaux denses de matière faits de protons et de neutrons et trouvés au centre des atomes – se sont formés par des réactions de fusion nucléaire, comme celles qui alimentent le Soleil.

À l\'époque où il y avait plus de photons à haute énergie dans l\'univers, tout noyau atomique qui se formait aurait été rapidement détruit par eux (un processus appelé photodésintégration). La BBN a cessé quelques minutes seulement après le Big Bang, mais ses conséquences sont observables aujourd\'hui.

Les observations des astronomes nous ont fourni des preuves des abondances primordiales d\'éléments produits dans ces réactions de fusion. Les résultats s\'accordent étroitement avec la théorie de la BBN. Si nous continuions, sur près de 14 milliards d\'années, nous atteindrions la situation qui existe aujourd\'hui. Mais à quel point pouvons-nous comprendre ce qui se passait près du moment du Big Bang lui-même ?

Les scientifiques n\'ont pas de preuve directe de ce qui s\'est passé avant la rupture de l\'unification électrofaible (lorsque l\'électromagnétisme et la force nucléaire faible ont cessé d\'être combinés). À des énergies aussi élevées et à des époques aussi anciennes, nous ne pouvons que contempler le mystère du Big Bang. Alors, que suggère la théorie ?

Lorsque nous remontons le temps à travers l\'histoire du cosmos, les distances et les volumes rétrécissent, tandis que la densité énergétique moyenne augmente. Au moment du Big Bang, les distances et les volumes tombent à zéro, toutes les parties de l\'univers tombent les unes sur les autres et la densité énergétique de l\'univers devient infinie. Nos équations mathématiques, qui décrivent l\'évolution de l\'espace et l\'expansion du cosmos, deviennent infestées de zéros et d\'infinis et cessent d\'avoir un sens.

Nous appelons cela une singularité. La théorie de la relativité générale d\'Albert Einstein décrit comment l\'espace-temps est façonné. L\'espace-temps est une façon de décrire la géométrie tridimensionnelle de l\'univers, mélangée au temps. Une courbure dans l\'espace-temps donne naissance à la gravité.

Mais les mathématiques suggèrent qu\'il existe des endroits dans l\'univers où la courbure de l\'espace-temps devient illimitée. Ces endroits sont connus sous le nom de singularités. Un tel exemple peut être trouvé au centre d\'un trou noir. À ces endroits, la théorie de la relativité générale s\'effondre.

De 1965 à 1966, les physiciens théoriciens britanniques Stephen Hawking et Roger Penrose ont présenté un certain nombre de théorèmes mathématiques démontrant que l\'espace-temps d\'un univers en expansion doit se terminer par une singularité dans le passé : la singularité du Big Bang.

Penrose a reçu le prix Nobel en 2020. Hawking est décédé en 2018 et les prix Nobel ne sont pas décernés à titre posthume. L\'espace et le temps apparaissent à la singularité du Big Bang, donc les questions sur ce qui se passe « avant » le Big Bang ne sont pas bien définies. Pour autant que la science puisse le dire, il n\'y a pas d\'avant ; le Big Bang est le début du temps.

Cependant, la nature n\'est pas décrite avec précision par la seule relativité générale, même si cette dernière existe depuis plus de 100 ans et n\'a pas été réfutée. La relativité générale ne peut pas décrire les atomes, la fusion nucléaire ou la radioactivité. Ces phénomènes sont plutôt abordés par la théorie quantique.

Les théories de la physique « classique », comme la relativité, sont déterministes. Cela signifie que certaines conditions initiales ont un résultat défini et sont donc absolument prédictives. La théorie quantique, quant à elle, est probabiliste. Cela signifie que certaines conditions initiales dans l\'univers peuvent avoir plusieurs résultats.

La théorie quantique est quelque peu prédictive, mais de manière probabiliste. Les résultats se voient attribuer une probabilité d\'existence. Si la distribution mathématique des probabilités est fortement concentrée sur un certain résultat, alors la situation est bien décrite par une théorie « classique » telle que la relativité générale. Mais tous les systèmes ne sont pas comme ça. Dans certains systèmes, par exemple les atomes, la distribution de probabilité est étalée et une description classique ne s\'applique pas.

Qu\'en est-il de la gravité ? Dans la grande majorité des cas, la gravité est bien décrite par la physique classique. L\'espace-temps classique est lisse. Cependant, lorsque la courbure devient extrême, près d\'une singularité, alors la nature quantique de la gravité ne peut être ignorée. Ici, l\'espace-temps n\'est plus lisse, mais noueux, semblable à un tapis qui semble lisse de loin mais qui, de près, est plein de fibres et de fils.

Ainsi, près de la singularité du Big Bang, la structure de l\'espace-temps cesse d\'être lisse. Les théorèmes mathématiques suggèrent que l\'espace-temps devient envahi par des caractéristiques « noueuses » : crochets, boucles et bulles. Cette situation fluctuant rapidement est appelée mousse d\'espace-temps.

Dans la mousse d\'espace-temps, la causalité ne s\'applique pas, car il y a des boucles fermées dans l\'espace-temps où le futur d\'un événement est aussi son passé (de sorte que son résultat peut aussi être sa cause). La nature probabiliste de la théorie quantique suggère que, lorsque la distribution de probabilité est uniformément répartie, tous les résultats sont également possibles et la notion confortable de causalité que nous associons à une compréhension classique de la physique est perdue.

Par conséquent, si nous remontons dans le temps, juste avant de rencontrer la singularité du Big Bang, nous nous retrouvons à entrer dans une époque où les effets quantiques de la gravité sont dominants et où la causalité ne s\'applique pas. C\'est ce qu\'on appelle l\'époque de Planck.

Le temps cesse d\'être linéaire, allant du passé vers le futur, et devient plutôt enveloppé, chaotique et aléatoire. Cela signifie que la question « pourquoi le Big Bang s\'est-il produit ? » n\'a pas de sens, car en dehors de la causalité, les événements n\'ont pas besoin d\'une cause pour se produire.

Afin de comprendre comment la physique fonctionne à une singularité comme le Big Bang, nous avons besoin d\'une théorie pour expliquer comment la gravité se comporte selon la théorie quantique. Malheureusement, nous n\'en avons pas. Il existe un certain nombre d\'efforts dans ce sens, comme la gravité quantique à boucles et la théorie des cordes, avec ses diverses incarnations.

Cependant, ces efforts sont au mieux incomplets, car le problème est notoirement difficile. Cela signifie que la mousse d\'espace-temps a une mystique totémique et puissante, un peu comme le Chaos antique d\'Hésiode que les Grecs croyaient exister au commencement.

Alors, comment notre univers en expansion et largement classique a-t-il jamais échappé à la mousse d\'espace-temps ? Cela nous amène à l\'inflation cosmique. Cette dernière est définie comme une période d\'expansion accélérée dans l\'univers primitif. Elle a été introduite pour la première fois par le physicien théoricien russe Alexei Starobinsky en 1980 et, parallèlement, la même année, par le physicien américain Alan Guth, qui a inventé le nom.

L\'inflation rend l\'univers grand et uniforme, selon les observations. Elle force également l\'univers à être spatialement plat, ce qui est une situation autrement instable, mais qui a également été confirmée par les observations. De plus, l\'inflation fournit un mécanisme naturel pour générer les irrégularités primordiales dans la densité de l\'univers qui sont essentielles pour la formation de structures telles que les galaxies et les amas de galaxies.

Des observations de précision du fond diffus cosmologique au cours des dernières décennies ont spectaculairement confirmé les prédictions de l\'inflation. Nous savons également que l\'univers peut en effet subir une expansion accélérée, car au cours des derniers milliards d\'années, il a recommencé à le faire.

Quel est le lien avec la mousse d\'espace-temps ? Eh bien, il s\'avère que, si les conditions de l\'inflation surviennent (par hasard) dans une région d\'espace-temps fluctuante, comme cela peut se produire avec la mousse d\'espace-temps, alors cette région s\'inflate et commence à se conformer à la physique classique.

Selon une idée proposée pour la première fois par le physicien russo-américain Andrei Linde, l\'inflation est une conséquence naturelle – et peut-être inévitable – des conditions initiales chaotiques dans l\'univers primitif.

Le fait est que notre univers classique pourrait avoir émergé de conditions chaotiques, comme celles de la mousse d\'espace-temps, en subissant une impulsion initiale d\'inflation. Cela aurait déclenché l\'expansion de l\'univers. En fait, les observations des astronomes du CMB suggèrent que l\'impulsion initiale est explosive, puisque l\'expansion est exponentielle pendant l\'inflation.

Le 20 mars 2014, Alan Guth l\'a expliqué succinctement : « Je décris généralement l\'inflation comme une théorie du « bang » du Big Bang : Elle décrit le mécanisme de propulsion que nous appelons le Big Bang. »

Voilà donc. L\'histoire de 14 milliards d\'années de notre univers commence par une explosion cataclysmique partout dans l\'espace, que nous appelons le Big Bang. Cela ne fait aucun doute raisonnable. Cette explosion est en réalité une période d\'expansion explosive, que nous appelons inflation cosmique. Mais que se passe-t-il avant l\'inflation ? Est-ce une singularité de l\'espace-temps, est-ce de la mousse d\'espace-temps ? La réponse est largement inconnue.

En fait, elle pourrait même être inconnaissable, car il existe un théorème mathématique qui nous interdit d\'accéder aux informations sur le début de l\'inflation, un peu comme celui qui nous empêche de connaître l\'intérieur des trous noirs. Donc, de notre point de vue, l\'inflation cosmique est le Big Bang, l\'explosion qui a tout déclenché.

            title: 'كل شيء بدء بانفجار عظيم – السعي لكشف غموض ولادة الكون',
            author: 'كونستانتينوس ديموبولوس',
            introduction: 'كيف بدأ كل شيء؟ هذا سؤال ظل البشر يفكرون فيه لآلاف السنين. على مدى القرن الماضي أو نحو ذلك، ركز العلم على إجابة واحدة: الانفجار العظيم.',
            excerpt: 'نظرة على الأدلة الخاصة بالانفجار العظيم، والخلفية الكونية الميكروية، والسعي لفهم ما حدث في بداية الكون.',
            body: `تصف هذه النظرية كيف ولد الكون في انفجار كارثي منذ حوالي 14 مليار سنة. في جزء صغير من الثانية، نما الكون المرصود بما يعادل تمدد بكتيريا إلى حجم مجرة درب التبانة. كان الكون المبكر حارًا جدًا وكثيفًا بشكل استثنائي. لكن كيف نعرف أن هذا حدث؟

دعونا ننظر أولاً إلى الأدلة. في عام 1929، اكتشف الفلكي الأمريكي إدوين هابل أن المجرات البعيدة تتحرك بعيدًا عن بعضها البعض، مما أدى إلى إدراك أن الكون يتوسع. إذا عدنا بالزمن إلى ولادة الكون، فسيعكس التوسع وستسقط المجرات فوق بعضها البعض منذ 14 مليار سنة. يتوافق هذا العمر بشكل جيد مع أعمار أقدم الأجرام الفلكية التي نرصدها.

قوبلت الفكرة في البداية بتشكيك – وكان المشكك هو الفلكي الإنجليزي فريد هويل الذي صاغ الاسم. رفض هويل الفرضية بسخرية على أنها "انفجار عظيم" خلال مقابلة مع إذاعة بي بي سي في 28 مارس 1949.

ثم في عام 1964، اكتشف أرنو بنزياس وروبرت ويلسون نوعًا معينًا من الإشعاع يملأ كل الفضاء. أصبح هذا يعرف بإشعاع الخلفية الكونية الميكروية (CMB). إنه نوع من التوهج اللاحق لانفجار الانفجار العظيم، الذي أطلق عندما كان الكون يبلغ من العمر 380,000 سنة فقط.

يوفر إشعاع الخلفية الكونية الميكروية نافذة على الظروف الحارة والكثيفة في بداية الكون. حصل بنزياس وويلسون على جائزة نوبل في الفيزياء عام 1978 لاكتشافهما.

في الآونة الأخيرة، سلطت التجارب في مسرعات الجسيمات مثل مصادم الهادرونات الكبير (LHC) الضوء على ظروف أقرب حتى إلى وقت الانفجار العظيم. يشير فهمنا للفيزياء عند هذه الطاقات العالية إلى أنه، في اللحظات الأولى بعد الانفجار العظيم، كانت القوى الأساسية الأربعة للفيزياء الموجودة اليوم مجتمعة في البداية في قوة واحدة.

القوى الأربعة الحالية هي الجاذبية، الكهرومغناطيسية، القوة النووية القوية، والقوة النووية الضعيفة. مع توسع الكون وبرودته، فصلت سلسلة من التغيرات الدراماتيكية، تسمى انتقالات الطور (مثل غليان الماء أو تجمده)، هذه القوى.

تشير التجارب في مسرعات الجسيمات إلى أن بضعة أجزاء من المليار من الثانية بعد الانفجار العظيم، حدث آخر هذه التحولات الطورية. كان هذا هو انهيار التوحيد الكهروضعيف، عندما توقفت الكهرومغناطيسية والقوة النووية الضعيفة عن الاتحاد. هذا هو الوقت الذي اكتسبت فيه كل المادة في الكون كتلتها.

بالانتقال إلى وقت لاحق، يملأ الكون مادة غريبة تسمى بلازما كوارك-غلوون. كما يشير الاسم، كانت هذه "الحساء البدائي" مكونة من كواركات وغلوونات. هذه هي جسيمات دون ذرية مسؤولة عن القوة النووية القوية. تم إنتاج بلازما الكوارك-غلوون اصطناعياً في عام 2010 في مختبر بروكهافن الوطني وفي عام 2015 في مصادم الهادرونات الكبير.

يجذب الكواركات والغلوونات بعضهم البعض بقوة وهم مرتبطون اليوم معاً كبروتونات ونيوترونات، والتي بدورها هي لبنات بناء الذرات. ومع ذلك، في الظروف الحارة والكثيفة للكون المبكر، كانت موجودة بشكل مستقل.

لم تدم بلازما الكوارك-غلوون طويلاً. بعد بضعة ملايين من الثانية فقط من الانفجار العظيم، مع توسع الكون وبرودته، تجمعت الكواركات والغلوونات معاً كبروتونات ونيوترونات، وهي الحالة التي تستمر حتى اليوم. يسمى هذا الحدث حصر الكوارك.

مع استمرار الكون في التوسع والبرودة أكثر، أصبح هناك عدد أقل من الفوتونات عالية الطاقة (جسيمات الضوء) في الكون مقارنة بما كان عليه سابقًا. هذا هو المحفز لعملية تسمى التخليق النووي للانفجار العظيم (BBN). هذا هو الوقت الذي تشكلت فيه النوى الذرية الأولى - الكتل الكثيفة من المادة المصنوعة من البروتونات والنيوترونات الموجودة في مراكز الذرات - من خلال تفاعلات الاندماج النووي، مثل تلك التي تمد الشمس بالطاقة.

في الماضي، عندما كان هناك المزيد من الفوتونات عالية الطاقة في الكون، فإن أي نوى ذرية تتشكل كانت ستتدمر بسرعة بواسطتها (عملية تسمى التفكك الضوئي). توقفت عملية BBN بعد دقائق قليلة من الانفجار العظيم، لكن عواقبها قابلة للملاحظة اليوم.

وفرت ملاحظات الفلكيين لنا أدلة على الوفرة البدائية للعناصر المنتجة في تفاعلات الاندماج هذه. تتوافق النائج بشكل وثيق مع نظرية BBN. إذا استمررنا، على مدى ما يقرب من 14 مليار سنة من الزمن، سنصل إلى الوضع الموجود اليوم. ولكن ما مدى قربنا من فهم ما كان يحدث بالقرب من لحظة الانفجار العظيم نفسها؟

ليس لدى العلماء دليل مباشر على ما حدث قبل انهيار التوحيد الكهروضعيف (عندما توقفت الكهرومغناطيسية والقوة النووية الضعيفة عن الاتحاد). عند مثل هذه الطاقات العالية والأزمنة المبكرة، لا يمكننا إلا أن نحدق في لغز الانفجار العظيم. إذن ماذا تقترح النظرية؟

عندما نعود بالزمن عبر تاريخ الكون، تتقلص المسافات والحجوم، بينما تزداد كثافة الطاقة المتوسطة. عند الانفجار العظيم، تنخفض المسافات والحجوم إلى الصفر، وتسقط جميع أجزاء الكون فوق بعضها البعض وتصبح كثافة طاقة الكون لانهائية. تصبح معادلاتنا الرياضية، التي تصف تطور الفضاء واتساع الكون، مليئة بالأصفار واللانهايات وتفقد معناها.

نسمي هذا التفرد. تصف نظرية النسبية العامة لألبرت أينشتاين كيف يتشكل الزمكان. الزمكان هو طريقة لوصف الهندسة ثلاثية الأبعاد للكون، مختلطة مع الزمن. يؤدي انحناء الزمكان إلى ظهور الجاذبية.

لكن الرياضيات تشير إلى وجود أماكن في الكون حيث يصبح انحناء الزمكان غير محدود. تُعرف هذه المواقع باسم التفردات. يمكن العثور على أحد هذه الأمثلة في مركز الثقب الأسود. في هذه الأماكن، تنهار نظرية النسبية العامة.

من عام 1965 إلى عام 1966، قدم الفيزيائيان النظريان البريطانيان ستيفن هوكينغ وروجر بنروز عددًا من النظريات الرياضية التي تثبت أن زمكان الكون المتوسع يجب أن ينتهي عند تفرد في الماضي: تفرد الانفجار العظيم.

حصل بنروز على جائزة نوبل في عام 2020. توفي هوكينغ في عام 2018 ولا تُمنح جوائز نوبل بعد الوفاة. يظهر المكان والزمان عند تفرد الانفجار العظيم، لذا فإن أسئلة ما يحدث "قبل" الانفجار العظيم ليست محددة جيدًا. بقدر ما تستطيع العلم أن تخبرنا، ليس هناك ما قبل؛ الانفجار العظيم هو بداية الزمن.

ومع ذلك، لا يتم وصف الطبيعة بدقة من خلال النسبية العامة وحدها، على الرغم من أن الأخيرة موجودة منذ أكثر من 100 عام ولم يتم دحضها. لا تستطيع النسبية العامة وصف الذرات أو الاندماج النووي أو النشاط الإشعاعي. يتم تناول هذه الظواهر بدلاً من ذلك من خلال نظرية الكم.

نظريات الفيزياء "الكلاسيكية"، مثل النسبية، حتمية. هذا يعني أن الظروف الأولية المعينة لها نتيجة محددة وبالتالي يمكن التنبؤ بها بشكل مطلق. من ناحية أخرى، نظرية الكم احتمالية. هذا يعني أن الظروف الأولية المعينة في الكون يمكن أن يكون لها نتائج متعددة.

نظرية الكم تنبؤية إلى حد ما، ولكن بطريقة احتمالية. يتم تعيين احتمالية الوجود للنتائج. إذا كانت التوزيع الرياضي للاحتمالات يرتفع بشكل حاد عند نتيجة معينة، فإن الوضع يوصف بشكل جيد بنظرية "كلاسيكية" مثل النسبية العامة. لكن ليس كل الأنظمة هكذا. في بعض الأنظمة، على سبيل المثال الذرات، ينتشر توزيع الاحتمالات ولا ينطبق الوصف الكلاسيكي.

ماذا عن الجاذبية؟ في الغالبية العظمى من الحالات، توصف الجاذبية بشكل جيد من خلال الفيزياء الكلاسيكية. الزمكان الكلاسيكي أملس. ومع ذلك، عندما يصبح الانحناء شديدًا، بالقرب من التفرد، فلا يمكن تجاهل الطبيعة الكمية للجاذبية. هنا، لم يعد الزمكان أملسًا، ولكنه متعرج، يشبه السجادة التي تبدو ملساء من بعيد ولكن من قريب تكون مليئة بالألياف والخيوط.

وهكذا، بالقرب من تفرد الانفجار العظيم، تتوقف بنية الزمكان عن كونها ملساء. تشير النظريات الرياضية إلى أن الزمكان يصبح مغمورًا بسمات "متعرجة": خطاطيف وحلقات وفقاعات. تسمى هذه الحالة المتقلبة بسرعة رغوة الزمكان.

في رغوة الزمكان، لا تنطبق السببية، لأن هناك حلقات مغلقة في الزمكان حيث يكون مستقبل حدث ما هو أيضًا ماضيه (بحيث يمكن أن تكون نتيجته أيضًا سببه). تشير الطبيعة الاحتمالية لنظرية الكم إلى أنه عندما يكون توزيع الاحتمالات منتشرًا بالتساوي، فإن جميع النتائج ممكنة بنفس القدر وتضيع فكرة السببية المريحة التي نربطها بالفهم الكلاسيكي للفيزياء.

لذلك، إذا عدنا بالزمن إلى الوراء، قبل أن نواجه تفرد الانفجار العظيم مباشرة، نجد أنفسنا ندخل حقبة تكون فيها التأثيرات الكمية للجاذبية هي المهيمنة ولا تنطبق السببية. هذا ما يسمى بحقبة بلانك.

يتوقف الزمن عن كونه خطيًا، ينتقل من الماضي إلى المستقبل، ويصبح بدلاً من ذلك ملفوفًا وفوضويًا وعشوائيًا. هذا يعني أن السؤال "لماذا حدث الانفجار العظيم؟" ليس له معنى، لأنه خارج السببية، لا تحتاج الأحداث إلى سبب لحدوثها.

من أجل فهم كيفية عمل الفيزياء في تفرد مثل الانفجار العظيم، نحتاج إلى نظرية لشرح كيفية تصرف الجاذبية وفقًا لنظرية الكم. لسوء الحظ، ليس لدينا واحدة. هناك عدد من الجهود في هذا الصدد مثل جاذبية الكم الحلقية ونظرية الأوتار، مع تجسيداتها المختلفة.

ومع ذلك، هذه الجهود غير مكتملة على أفضل تقدير، لأن المشكلة صعبة للغاية. هذا يعني أن رغوة الزمكان لها غموض قوي وطوطمي، يشبه إلى حد كبير الفوضى القديمة لهزيود التي اعتقد اليونانيون أنها موجودة في البداية.

إذن كيف تمكن كوننا المتوسع والكلاسيكي إلى حد كبير من الهروب من رغوة الزمكان؟ هذا يقودنا إلى التضخم الكوني. يُعرَّف الأخير بأنه فترة توسع متسارع في الكون المبكر. قدمه لأول مرة الفيزيائي النظري الروسي أليكسي ستاروبينسكي في عام 1980 وبالتوازي، في نفس العام، من قبل الفيزيائي الأمريكي آلان غوث، الذي صاغ الاسم.

يجعل التضخم الكون كبيرًا وموحدًا، وفقًا للملاحظات. كما يجبر الكون على أن يكون مسطحًا مكانيًا، وهي حالة غير مستقرة بخلاف ذلك، ولكن تم تأكيدها أيضًا بالملاحظات. علاوة على ذلك، يوفر التضخم آلية طبيعية لتوليد الاختلالات البدائية في كثافة الكون التي تعتبر ضرورية لتشكيل هياكل مثل المجرات والعناقيد المجرية.

أكدت الملاحظات الدقيقة للخلفية الكونية الميكروية في العقود الأخيرة تنبؤات التضخم بشكل مذهل. نعلم أيضًا أن الكون يمكنه بالفعل الخضوع لتوسع متسارع، لأنه في آخر بضعة مليارات من السنين بدأ يفعل ذلك مرة أخرى.

ما علاقة هذا برغوة الزمكان؟ حسنًا، اتضح أنه إذا ظهرت شروط التضخم (بالصدفة) في رقعة من الزمكان المتقلب، كما يمكن أن يحدث مع رغوة الزمكان، فإن هذه المنطقة تتضخم وتبدأ في التوافق مع الفيزياء الكلاسيكية.

وفقًا لفكرة اقترحها الفيزيائي الروسي الأمريكي أندريه ليند لأول مرة، فإن التضخم هو نتيجة طبيعية – وربما حتمية – للظروف الأولية الفوضوية في الكون المبكر.

النقطة المهمة هي أن كوننا الكلاسيكي كان يمكن أن ينشأ من ظروف فوضوية، مثل تلك الموجودة في رغوة الزمكان، من خلال تجربة دفعة أولية من التضخم. كان من شأن ذلك أن يؤدي إلى توسع الكون. في الواقع، تشير ملاحظات الفلكيين لـ CMB إلى أن الدفعة الأولية هي انفجارية، حيث أن التوسع أسي خلال التضخم.

في 20 مارس 2014، شرح آلان غوث ذلك بإيجاز: "عادة ما أصف التضخم على أنه نظرية 'الانفجار' للانفجار العظيم: إنه يصف آلية الدفع التي نسميها الانفجار العظيم."

إذن ها أنت ذا. تبدأ قصة كوننا البالغة 14 مليار سنة بانفجار كارثي في كل مكان في الفضاء، نسميه الانفجار العظيم. هذا لا يدع مجالاً للشك المعقول. هذا الانفجار هو في الواقع فترة من التوسع الانفجاري، نسميها التضخم الكوني. لكن ماذا يحدث قبل التضخم؟ هل هو تفرد الزمكان، هل هو رغوة الزمكان؟ الجواب غير معروف إلى حد كبير.

في الواقع، قد يكون غير معروف، لأن هناك نظرية رياضية تمنعنا من الوصول إلى المعلومات حول بداية التضخم، تمامًا مثل النظرية التي تمنعنا من معرفة ما بداخل الثقوب السوداء. لذا، من وجهة نظرنا، التضخم الكوني هو الانفجار العظيم، الانفجار الذي بدأ كل شيء.

            title: 'Black Holes: Gravity\'s Ultimate Victory',
            author: 'Prof. Michael Chen',
            introduction: 'Black holes represent some of the most extreme and fascinating objects in the universe, where gravity has completely overcome all other forces.',
            excerpt: 'Understanding the formation, properties, and observational evidence for these mysterious cosmic phenomena.',
            body: `Black holes are regions of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing—no particles or even electromagnetic radiation such as light—can escape from it. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole.

## Formation and Types

Black holes form through several mechanisms:

1. **Stellar Black Holes**: Created when massive stars (at least 3 times the mass of our Sun) exhaust their nuclear fuel and collapse under their own gravity. The core collapse triggers a supernova explosion, while the remaining core forms a black hole.

2. **Supermassive Black Holes**: Found at the centers of most galaxies, including our Milky Way. These behemoths contain millions to billions of solar masses. Their formation mechanism remains an active area of research, possibly forming from the direct collapse of massive gas clouds or through the merger of smaller black holes.

3. **Intermediate-Mass Black Holes**: With masses between 100 and 100,000 solar masses, these represent a missing link in black hole evolution. Recent gravitational wave observations have provided evidence for their existence.

> "Black holes are not the eternal prisons they were once thought. Things can get out of a black hole both to the outside and possibly to another universe. So if you feel you are in a black hole, don't give up. There's a way out." - Stephen Hawking

## Event Horizon and Singularity

The boundary of no return surrounding a black hole is called the event horizon. Once anything crosses this boundary, it cannot escape the black hole's gravitational pull. The radius of the event horizon for a non-rotating black hole is known as the Schwarzschild radius.

At the center of a black hole lies the singularity—a point where density and gravity become infinite and spacetime curvature becomes infinite. According to general relativity, all the mass of a black hole is concentrated at this dimensionless point.

## Observational Evidence

While black holes themselves are invisible, astronomers can detect them through their effects on surrounding matter:

- **Accretion Disks**: As matter falls toward a black hole, it forms a rotating disk of superheated gas and dust. Friction within the disk heats the material to millions of degrees, causing it to emit X-rays that can be detected.

- **Gravitational Lensing**: The extreme gravity of black holes bends light from objects behind them, creating characteristic distortion patterns.

- **Gravitational Waves**: The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) has detected gravitational waves from merging black holes, providing direct evidence of their existence.

- **Event Horizon Telescope**: In 2019, the EHT collaboration released the first-ever image of a black hole's event horizon, capturing the supermassive black hole at the center of galaxy M87.

## Hawking Radiation and Information Paradox

Stephen Hawking proposed in 1974 that black holes are not completely black but emit small amounts of thermal radiation due to quantum effects near the event horizon. This Hawking radiation causes black holes to slowly lose mass and eventually evaporate over astronomical timescales.

The black hole information paradox arises from the apparent conflict between quantum mechanics and general relativity regarding information preservation. According to quantum mechanics, information cannot be destroyed, but black holes seem to destroy information that falls into them. Resolving this paradox remains a major challenge in theoretical physics.`,

## Formation et Types

Les trous noirs se forment par plusieurs mécanismes:

1. **Trous Noirs Stellaire** : Créés lorsque des étoiles massives (au moins 3 fois la masse de notre Soleil) épuisent leur combustible nucléaire et s'effondrent sous leur propre gravité. L'effondrement du cœur déclenche une explosion de supernova, tandis que le cœur restant forme un trou noir.

2. **Trous Noirs Supermassifs** : Trouvés au centre de la plupart des galaxies, y compris notre Voie Lactée. Ces géants contiennent des millions à des milliards de masses solaires. Leur mécanisme de formation reste un domaine de recherche actif, se formant peut-être à partir de l'effondrement direct de nuages de gaz massifs ou par la fusion de trous noirs plus petits.

3. **Trous Noirs de Masse Intermédiaire** : Avec des masses entre 100 et 100 000 masses solaires, ils représentent un lien manquant dans l'évolution des trous noirs. Des observations récentes d'ondes gravitationnelles ont fourni des preuves de leur existence.`

## التكوين والأنواع

تتشكل الثقوب السوداء من خلال عدة آليات:

1. **الثقوب السوداء النجمية**: تتشكل عندما تستنفد النجوم الضخمة (ثلاثة أضعاف كتلة شمسنا على الأقل) وقودها النووي و تنهار تحت جاذبيتها الخاصة. يؤدي انهيار النواة إلى انفجار مستعر أعظم، بينما تشكل النواة المتبقية ثقباً أسود.

2. **الثقوب السوداء فائقة الكتلة**: توجد في مراكز معظم المجرات، بما في ذلك مجرتنا درب التبانة. تحتوي هذه العمالقة على ملايين إلى مليارات الكتل الشمسية. يظل آلية تكوينها مجال بحث نشط، ربما تتشكل من الانهيار المباشر لسحب الغاز الضخمة أو من خلال اندماج ثقوب سوداء أصغر.

3. **الثقوب السوداء متوسطة الكتلة**: بكتل بين 100 و 100,000 كتلة شمسية، تمثل رابطاً مفقوداً في تطور الثقوب السوداء. قدمت ملاحظات موجات الجاذبية الحديثة دليلاً على وجودها.`
